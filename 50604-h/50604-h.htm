<br />The Empty Chair</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; exclaimed Irene Meredith, ducking
to protect her face from a biting wind that was
blowing across the skating area at Radio City.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go inside now, Judy? It&rsquo;s really
too cold to enjoy ice skating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> cold,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;What a difference from
the way it was in the summer! They had chairs out
here then, and there were flowered umbrellas over the
tables. But with the big Christmas tree up, Radio City
is still beautiful in spite of the cold. Don&rsquo;t you wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy did not finish the sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you two?&rdquo; Pauline Faulkner
demanded as she stopped short, almost colliding
with Judy and Irene. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just stop skating and
gaze at the sights. Other people will bump into you.
There, I knew it!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<p>&ldquo;Watch it!&rdquo; someone called out just too late.</p>
<p>Florence Garner, the fourth member of the skating
party, turned sharply on her skates and went sprawling.
But she was soon picking herself up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, Flo?&rdquo; Irene asked solicitously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry,&rdquo; Judy added. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to
upset you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m upset in more ways than one,&rdquo; Florence replied
as the four girls skated off the ice. &ldquo;Nothing is
turning out the way I planned it. Pauline said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind what I said,&rdquo; Judy&rsquo;s dark-haired
friend interrupted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll discuss it at lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the rented skates had been returned,
and the four girls were sitting around a table
in a nearby restaurant. The waiter served steaming
hot soup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will warm us up,&rdquo; Irene commented over her
soup plate. &ldquo;Remember, Judy, I promised you we&rsquo;d
skate by the golden statue the next time you came to
New York, and now we&rsquo;ve done it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was fun, but watching your television show will
be the real treat,&rdquo; Judy told her. &ldquo;When do you have
to be at the studio for rehearsal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until two. There&rsquo;s lots of time.&rdquo; Irene looked
at the girl she had first known as Judy Bolton. She
herself had been Irene Lang then, a timid little mill
worker with a secret ambition to become a singer.
Now, although her ambition had been realized and
she was also a happy young wife and mother, she still
looked to Judy for advice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a big decision to make,&rdquo; Irene confessed.
&ldquo;If you were in my place, Judy, you&rsquo;d know what to
do. I don&rsquo;t want your little namesake to think of her
mommy as one of the &lsquo;naughty&rsquo; people on television.
That&rsquo;s what she calls the people who do the commercials.
We even have a little song we sing about
it. Dale and I made it up to amuse little Judy. Of
course, I&rsquo;d never dare use it on my show,&rdquo; Irene added
with a laugh. &ldquo;The sponsor would never get over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sing it, Irene,&rdquo; Judy urged her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here?&rdquo; The Golden Girl of TV and radio
looked about the restaurant as if she had been asked to
commit a crime. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could if you sang it very softly. Come on,
I&rsquo;d like to hear it, too,&rdquo; Pauline urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; Irene gave in. &ldquo;We call it &lsquo;<i>When I
Grow Up</i>,&rsquo; and it goes like this:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>When I grow up I&rsquo;ll be a teacher or a hostess on a plane,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Or perhaps I&rsquo;ll be the weather girl and know about the rain.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>I might sing and play like Mommy on TV or radio,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>But I wouldn&rsquo;t do commercials,</i></p>
<p class="t"><i>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t do commercials,</i></p>
<p class="t2"><i>No, I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t <i>do commercials and interrupt the show</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like them much either,&rdquo; agreed Judy after
the song was over and she had stopped laughing.
&ldquo;Especially when you see the same thing over and
over. It makes a person wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what?&rdquo; asked Pauline.</p>
<p>Irene laughed. &ldquo;Judy is always wondering about
something,&rdquo; she explained to Florence Garner. &ldquo;Her
husband, Peter Dobbs, calls her his wonder girl.
Peter is&mdash;&rdquo; She paused. &ldquo;Shall I tell her, Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll find out anyway. He&rsquo;s an FBI agent. It isn&rsquo;t
something you can keep from your friends. Of
course,&rdquo; Judy added, &ldquo;there are times when it&rsquo;s better
if people don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Criminals, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean anybody. Right now Peter is away on an
assignment. I don&rsquo;t even know where he is. But let&rsquo;s
talk about you, Flo,&rdquo; Judy suggested to change the
subject. &ldquo;Is it all right if I call you by your first
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. I know we just met today, but I feel
as if I&rsquo;d known you always,&rdquo; the brown-haired girl
returned warmly. &ldquo;Pauline has told me so much about
you. I work for an advertising agency on Madison
Avenue not far from the office where Emily Grimshaw
holds forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. Pauline&rsquo;s employer was a literary
agent who peddled the works of busy authors like
Irene&rsquo;s husband, the detective story writer, Dale
Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She knows how to get contracts from publishers.
Getting advertising accounts isn&rsquo;t easy, either,&rdquo; Florence
continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid a good many people share
Irene&rsquo;s feelings about commercials and with reason.
You should hear those ad men when they&rsquo;re in conference.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read about them,&rdquo; declared Judy. &ldquo;Is it true
that advertising agencies employ psychologists to
probe into people&rsquo;s minds and find out how to make
them buy certain products?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; Pauline, the daughter of a
psychiatrist, was indignant about it and said so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any harm in that,&rdquo; Flo said defensively.
&ldquo;They push the items they&rsquo;re paid to put across. Take
the golden hair wash people, for instance. It was pure
inspiration when they thought of Irene to sponsor
their product. Golden Girl&mdash;golden hair wash! Can&rsquo;t
you just see it on the TV screen? Their hair wash will
sell like crazy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And every girl will be a golden girl. I just can&rsquo;t
agree to it,&rdquo; Irene interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have to say I use
the stuff when I don&rsquo;t. My hair is naturally this color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine is naturally this color, too. So help me!&rdquo; put
in Judy. &ldquo;I dyed it once to disguise myself, but never
again! Anyway, Peter likes redheads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline, a blue-eyed, black-haired beauty, seemed to
be studying the others at the table. Each girl had her
own distinctive coloring. Irene, with her naturally
golden blond hair, wore it in a short bob. &ldquo;To keep
little Judy from pulling it when we romp,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Judy wore her curly auburn hair in a long bob,
while Florence Garner had her brown hair pinned
high on her head. It, too, was curly and would have
hung in ringlets if she had let it loose.</p>
<p>A fifth chair at the table was vacant. But Judy,
suddenly a little homesick, could imagine Peter&rsquo;s sister
sitting there to complete the picture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honey&rsquo;s hair is darker than yours, Irene,&rdquo; she
spoke up unexpectedly. &ldquo;I call it honey colored. I
hope she never uses that golden hair wash to change
it. Honey simply wouldn&rsquo;t be Honey without her
lovely honey-colored hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,&rdquo; Pauline
quoted airily. &ldquo;Honey&rsquo;s hair is actually just plain dark
blond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our advertising will be directed toward dark
blonds. Naturally they want their hair to be golden.
Who is Honey, anyway?&rdquo; asked Flo. &ldquo;You keep looking
at that empty chair as if she were sitting at the
table with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is&mdash;in spirit.&rdquo; This was Irene. Judy laughed
and added, &ldquo;Honey is Peter&rsquo;s sister. We all love her,
especially my brother, Horace. He&rsquo;s a newspaper reporter,
and she&rsquo;s supplied him with plenty of news.
There was a time when we didn&rsquo;t know she existed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder!&rdquo; exclaimed Flo, laughing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s invisible
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy is trying to tell you about one of the mysteries
she solved,&rdquo; Pauline explained, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s no use,
Judy. There have been so many. Phantoms just follow
you around waiting for you to pull off their sheets
and show them up for what they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are they?&rdquo; asked Florence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illusions, usually.&rdquo; Judy found the word a little
difficult to define. &ldquo;People think they see things that
are really something quite different. Or else they&rsquo;re
imaginary&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>&ldquo;Like our phantom friend in the chair,&rdquo; Irene interrupted
with a laugh. &ldquo;Shall we ask the waiter to
bring an extra order&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you expecting someone else to join you for
lunch?&rdquo; the waiter paused at the table to ask.</p>
<p>He had overheard only part of the conversation.
Judy could hardly stop herself from laughing. She was
about to tell him it was only a joke when a commotion
at the cashier&rsquo;s desk drew her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave you a twenty-dollar bill,&rdquo; a tall girl with a
country twang in her voice was insisting. &ldquo;I know it
was a twenty. But you&rsquo;ve given me change for only
a dollar. Where&rsquo;s the other nineteen dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />Clarissa Valentine</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the girl who was sitting alone at the
next table?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I noticed her watching you
and smiling when you were singing that song, Irene.
She seemed to be enjoying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew I shouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irene stopped. The girl at the cashier&rsquo;s desk was
really in trouble. Her voice had risen to a wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a thief!&rdquo; she cried out melodramatically.
&ldquo;Daddy warned me against people like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daddy should have warned you to be more
careful of your money,&rdquo; the cashier retorted sarcastically.
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve lost twenty dollars&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;You took it from
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor girl! She really thinks she&rsquo;s been cheated,&rdquo;
Irene whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; said Flo, &ldquo;especially when she&rsquo;s
angry. That girl ought to be in advertising. She&rsquo;s just
the unspoiled type of beauty we&rsquo;re looking for. Of
course, she ought to do something about her hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shampoo it with golden hair wash, I suppose?
Please, Flo, don&rsquo;t try to make her over,&rdquo; Irene pleaded.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in enough trouble as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if the cashier is going to win the argument,&rdquo;
observed Judy. &ldquo;I feel sorry for the girl if he
really is trying to cheat her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely she&rsquo;s trying to cheat him. She could
be putting on an act,&rdquo; declared Pauline. &ldquo;There, I
told you so. Now she&rsquo;s turned on the tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a moment the weeping country girl was surrounded
by a little knot of concerned people who had
left their tables to try and settle the matter. As they
pressed toward him the cashier flung open the cash
drawer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see!&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no twenty! I
haven&rsquo;t changed a twenty-dollar bill all day. She&rsquo;s
made a mistake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; the girl retorted tearfully. &ldquo;I know
what I gave you. It was a twenty. Now I don&rsquo;t have
money enough for my fare home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; he asked as if concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I tell you, will you give me my nineteen dollars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get away with a
trick like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll call the police,&rdquo; she threatened. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
let you cheat me out of all the money I have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the police will believe you?&rdquo; the
man inquired in a lower tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what happened to my twenty dollars if I didn&rsquo;t give
it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; he exclaimed triumphantly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve admitted
you lost it before you came into this restaurant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did nothing of the kind. Doesn&rsquo;t anybody in New
York care about the truth?&rdquo; The girl seemed to be
asking this question of the other people in the restaurant.
&ldquo;Please, mister,&rdquo; she began to plead, &ldquo;give me
back my change so I can go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; The cashier seemed almost sympathetic.
Yet he remained firm in his refusal to give the
girl any money, insisting that she must have lost the
bill she thought she gave him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, sit with us and tell us all about it.&rdquo; Judy offered
on impulse. &ldquo;We care about the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll look in that man&rsquo;s pockets,&rdquo; declared
the nearly hysterical girl. &ldquo;He took it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would report him to the manager,&rdquo; Florence
Garner suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And make him lose his job? Mistakes happen,&rdquo; declared
Pauline Faulkner. &ldquo;We have no way of knowing
which of you is in the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; The girl controlled her sobs and said,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of you to take an interest in me. I needed
that twenty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we each chip in five dollars, you&rsquo;ll still have
money enough to take you home. You may consider
it a loan,&rdquo; Irene said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; The girl smiled for the first time.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a genuine Golden Girl. I&rsquo;ve seen you on
television. I recognized your voice, too, when you
sang that funny song. You&rsquo;re Irene Meredith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am.&rdquo; Irene introduced the other girls and
offered the newcomer the vacant chair at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now our phantom friend is real,&rdquo; declared Judy.</p>
<p>The girl looked startled. &ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m real. Once,&rdquo;
she confessed, &ldquo;I looked in the mirror, and there was
no reflection. It scared me half out of my wits. Why
do you call me a phantom friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were pretending we had a fifth girl at the
table. It was just a joke. You do have a name, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Clarissa,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;Clarissa Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a stage name,&rdquo; declared Pauline.
&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t an actress, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;d like to be. That&rsquo;s why I came to New
York,&rdquo; Clarissa admitted. &ldquo;At home we had a little
theater group for a while. But they&rsquo;re old-fashioned
down there. Some of the people in my father&rsquo;s parish
didn&rsquo;t think it proper for a minister&rsquo;s daughter to act
on the stage. We had to give up the little theater, so I
coaxed Daddy to let me come here. I thought I could
get a little part on TV, but I was wrong. I couldn&rsquo;t
get any kind of a job. I was all out of money when
Daddy sent me that twenty dollars for Christmas. He
said he hoped I&rsquo;d spend it for a ticket back home to
West Virginia. I was going to take the train tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can still take it if you let us help you. Meantime,&rdquo;
Florence Garner suggested, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you
join us for a tour of Radio City, my treat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; asked Clarissa, obviously surprised.
&ldquo;Touring Radio City was one of the things I
especially wanted to do. Will we see ourselves on
television?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you joking?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;How could we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; Irene promised. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a live show
you may catch if you hurry. But perhaps you&rsquo;d rather
wait and see mine tonight. Francine Dow is playing
the Sleeping Beauty. You&rsquo;ll love her in it. I&rsquo;m lucky to
have her as a guest on my show. She can really act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So can you, Irene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Golden Girl of TV and radio tossed Judy&rsquo;s
compliment aside. &ldquo;I can sing and tell stories. That&rsquo;s
about all. A part like this takes real talent. When you
see the show you&rsquo;ll understand. Notice the equipment
and don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions of the guide
while you&rsquo;re taking the tour,&rdquo; Irene continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
enjoy my show more if you know the types of
cameras being used and understand what the men on
the floor are doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are the men on the floor?&rdquo; asked Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t time to tell you now. The guide will
explain it. I must dash, or I&rsquo;ll be late for rehearsal. Our
studio is way uptown. Here&rsquo;s the address.&rdquo; Irene
handed Judy a card on which she had written, &ldquo;Admit
four.&rdquo; &ldquo;That includes Clarissa if she wants to come.
You know I&rsquo;m not on one of the big networks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could be,&rdquo; Florence began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Irene stopped her. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be on anything
if I&rsquo;m late for rehearsal. Turn in your contributions,
girls, and let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa seemed almost too eager to accept the four
bills the girls offered her. They paid the cashier,
counting their change carefully, and left the restaurant
together.</p>
<p>Outside, the wind had increased, sending swirls and
flurries of snow ahead of them as they crossed the
street. They could scarcely see each other through
the whiteness in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you here. Cheer up, Flo. I&rsquo;ll let you know
my decision in a day or two,&rdquo; Irene promised as she
hurried off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk her into it, Judy,&rdquo; urged Pauline.</p>
<p>The four girls had entered the RCA Building, glad
of the warmth they found inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk her into <i>what</i>?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
don&rsquo;t know the language. Do you have a new sponsor
for Irene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the golden hair wash people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Judy said and was suddenly silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would she be on one of the big networks?&rdquo; asked
Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the biggest. You&rsquo;d see her on your TV at
home, Judy. Isn&rsquo;t that worth thinking about? You
can talk her into it if anyone can,&rdquo; Flo urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll discuss it with her. How do the rest of you feel
about it?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think she ought to accept the offer,&rdquo; Pauline
volunteered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with commercials
if they&rsquo;re in good taste. Lots of stars do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a selling job like any other. The sponsor pays
for the program,&rdquo; put in Flo. &ldquo;I wish Irene could
see it that way. She could sell golden hair wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t believe in it,&rdquo; Judy objected. &ldquo;If she
used the stuff herself it would be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d use it. I&rsquo;d do anything,&rdquo; declared Clarissa. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
dye my hair green to get on TV.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly ever necessary,&rdquo; laughed Flo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we really see ourselves on television when we
take this tour?&rdquo; Pauline questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy asked at the information desk to make sure
and came back all excited. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;The guide just told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are we waiting for?&rdquo; asked Clarissa.</p>
<p>Taking Judy&rsquo;s arm, she pulled her on down the
concourse until they came to a high desk where tickets
were being sold. Judy found herself paying for them
although Florence Garner had been the one to suggest
the tour.</p>
<p>Clarissa clutched her ticket eagerly and whispered,
as if to herself, &ldquo;I hope I <i>show</i>. It would be terrible
if I just faded away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />Tour Thirteen</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say <i>faded</i> or <i>fainted</i>?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;People
don&rsquo;t faint away unless they&rsquo;re ill. You feel all
right, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a little trembly,&rdquo; Clarissa confessed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited,
I guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to be excited about,&rdquo; Pauline told
her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken this tour before. You just see behind
the scenes in the different studios. It&rsquo;s a little dull,
really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Clarissa did not think so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dull? How can you say that? If we see ourselves
on television&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice from a loudspeaker interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tour Thirteen leaves in five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be us!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>About a dozen people were waiting at the top of a
short flight of stairs. Some of them were watching TV
as they waited. Judy and her friends joined them. The
set had been tuned to one of the local channels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Teen Time Party!&rdquo; exclaimed Pauline.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be there dancing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re high school students, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; asked
Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of them, I guess. There are probably a few
professionals among them,&rdquo; Pauline added. &ldquo;This one,
for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lovely, golden-haired girl and her partner
were caught by the camera in a close-up. The announcer
turned to the audience and said, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t her
hair beautiful? You, too, can be a beautiful golden
blonde. Shampoo glamorous new beauty into your
hair with golden hair wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I use it. Why don&rsquo;t you try it?&rdquo; asked the girl on
the television screen.</p>
<p>In a moment she was dancing again, mixing with
the other teenagers as if she were one of them. She
wasn&rsquo;t a star. Judy had never seen her on television
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she was thinking, &ldquo;is all Irene would have
to say. &lsquo;<i>I use it.</i>&rsquo; Three little words, but they&rsquo;re not
true. Irene doesn&rsquo;t use it. Maybe she should. Her hair
is dull and drab. Why am I thinking that?&rdquo; Judy asked
herself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>my</i> hair that&rsquo;s dull and drab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; Florence asked. Judy had not realized
she was speaking her thoughts aloud. Florence went
on, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny, Judy. You wouldn&rsquo;t want your
hair any brighter than it is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;I guess I wouldn&rsquo;t. I always
thought it was too bright before. I don&rsquo;t know why I
said that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; Clarissa spoke up. &ldquo;You read my thoughts.
I was just thinking my hair is dull. I could be beautiful
if I didn&rsquo;t have this drab, dull hair. It was lighter when
I was small. It was really golden then. But all at once
it began to get darker. I changed in other ways, too.
Mother says I must be a changeling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Changelings aren&rsquo;t real,&rdquo; Pauline stopped her.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re what witches were supposed to leave when
they snatched real children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a witch in Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; Flo put in.
&ldquo;Irene says her dance is the best thing in the whole
show. This tour is nothing compared to what we&rsquo;ll see
tonight, but it will kill time until seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean six-thirty,&rdquo; Judy corrected her. &ldquo;We
have to be at the studio half an hour before the show
begins, and I would like to be there even earlier than
that so Irene can explain things. There&rsquo;s so much I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide, overhearing Judy&rsquo;s remark, smiled and
said, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re going to visit the Golden Girl show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s treason,&rdquo; Pauline whispered. &ldquo;Irene&rsquo;s show is
on another channel. So is Teen Time Party. One of
the tourists must have turned it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was off now. In its place a gay crowd of young
people were singing the praises of a popular cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of our accounts,&rdquo; Flo said proudly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wasted on me. I don&rsquo;t smoke,&rdquo; laughed Judy
as the tour moved on to a large room lined with
pictures of television stars appearing on the big network.
People were pointing and exclaiming, each one
seeming to have his own favorite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irene&rsquo;s picture should be up there,&rdquo; Flo remarked,
&ldquo;but she wouldn&rsquo;t do commercials, no, she wouldn&rsquo;t
do commercials, no, she <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> do commercials&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Flo, don&rsquo;t make fun of Irene,&rdquo; begged Judy.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s only standing up for what she believes is the
right thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How right is it to throw away money you could
be making?&rdquo; Flo countered. &ldquo;Judy, you must talk her
into accepting this offer. Tell her you think it&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what I think. If she really used golden
hair wash then she wouldn&rsquo;t have to say anything that
wasn&rsquo;t true, would she? I think I&rsquo;ll buy a bottle and
ask her to try it,&rdquo; Judy decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I try it, too? Brown is a dull color,&rdquo; Flo began,
but was interrupted. The guide, a brown-haired
girl herself, stepped to the head of the line and announced
that the tour was about to begin. The group
followed her to an elevator that whisked them up to
one of the smaller studios. They had just missed the
show Irene had mentioned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to watch a set being dismantled?
There aren&rsquo;t any live shows being televised at present,&rdquo;
the guide said as she ushered the group to a
row of seats behind what she told them was soundproof
glass. A small television set that she called a
monitor was at the left of the seats. In front of it, on
the other side of the glass, the studio floor was alive
with activity. Cameras and microphones were being
pushed out of the way. The walls of what had been
an indoor scene were rolled back and replaced by a
huge weather map. The weather girl would be the
next person to use this studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we see her?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>This was a program she and Peter often watched
at their home in Dry Brook Hollow. She thought of
watching Irene, and the wish to see her dearest friend
on television became so strong she could think of
nothing else except, &ldquo;She should use golden hair
wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy! We&rsquo;re going to the control room now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy came out of her trance to realize that Pauline
was speaking to her. She was the last one on the line
that wended its way toward the glass-enclosed control
room where the engineers sat before rows of monitor
screens awaiting word from the director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says &lsquo;take one&rsquo; or &lsquo;take two,&rsquo; and in a split
second the picture he wants is on the screen,&rdquo; the
guide explained. &ldquo;When a live show is on the air, the
cameras are working all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the lights?&rdquo; asked one of the strangers
taking the tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lighting a show is an engineering feat in itself.&rdquo;
And the guide went on to explain the flashing red
and green lights as well as the other technical
equipment being handled by the crew on duty in the
control room. On the wall above their heads were
clocks that told what time it was all over the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; everyone agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>A wall chart farther down the corridor explained
the inside story of color television. It was complete
with push buttons and flashing lights. The men taking
the tour were especially interested. Pauline said she
recognized one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognize him, too,&rdquo; Florence agreed. &ldquo;He
works for our agency. It&rsquo;s funny he didn&rsquo;t speak to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too interested in what the guide is telling him
to speak to anybody,&rdquo; Judy observed.</p>
<p>The man was interested. He was young with
straight brown hair that kept falling over his forehead
as he leaned forward to examine this or that gadget.
The guide was giving him most of her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we see ourselves on TV?&rdquo; Clarissa
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; Pauline told her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming to that.
We stand in front of a camera, and the guide interviews
us, but I think we go up to the sound-effects
room first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s radio, isn&rsquo;t it? I watched the sound-effects
man once on a radio broadcast,&rdquo; Judy remembered.
&ldquo;It was right here in Radio City, but I had a mystery
to solve and didn&rsquo;t take the whole tour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others asked her about the mystery, and she
began to tell them about what happened before she
and Peter Dobbs were married. &ldquo;Irene had a radio
show then. It was the summer before little Judy was
born. Honey was just out of art school. Peter and I
drove to New York to bring her home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Honey?&rdquo; asked Clarissa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>For the second time that day Judy explained that
Peter&rsquo;s sister had been in their thoughts when they
pretended at the table in the restaurant. &ldquo;We
called her a phantom just for fun. And then you came
and sat in her chair,&rdquo; Judy continued. &ldquo;It did seem a
little weird. You&rsquo;re like Honey in many ways. You&rsquo;re
taller, of course, and your hair is darker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much longer,&rdquo; declared Clarissa. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to buy a bottle of that golden hair wash with
some of the money you girls lent me. Then I&rsquo;ll be
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> beautiful,&rdquo; Flo insisted. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say so,
girls? There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the color of your
hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s drab. It&rsquo;s dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop it, Clarissa!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;We lent you
that money for your fare home, not to waste on
shampoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be wasted. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will your folks say?&rdquo; asked Pauline. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the daughter of a country minister, aren&rsquo;t you? People
will talk&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them! I won&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re impossible!&rdquo; Flo exclaimed. &ldquo;How old are
you, anyway? You ought to be at home going to
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa wouldn&rsquo;t tell her age. She wouldn&rsquo;t tell anything
more about herself or her plans. Judy was looking
forward to the TV interviews. The guide might
ask Clarissa some leading questions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />Strange Questions</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed to be finding out things on this
tour,&rdquo; complained Judy as they stopped to look in on
another studio, &ldquo;but I keep thinking about my hair.
I&rsquo;m like you, Clarissa. I want to rush right out and buy
a bottle of that golden hair wash. But why? I&rsquo;d never
use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you want to buy it for Irene,&rdquo; Flo suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really. That&rsquo;s just it. I don&rsquo;t want to buy
it at all, and yet I feel compelled to try it. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know why I want to,&rdquo; Clarissa insisted. &ldquo;If I had
beautiful golden hair I might not go home at all. I
might stay here and get a job doing commercials. See
that girl on the floor now? I could do what she&rsquo;s
doing. I could demonstrate a magic cleaner as well as
she can. I did plenty of cleaning and scrubbing at
home, and I didn&rsquo;t have any little fairy to help me,
either. Look, girls! See that little fairy dancing around
the sink. It isn&rsquo;t there, but you can see it on the
monitor. How do they make it look like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide explained it. A cartoon film was placed
in a camera she called a balopticon so that the fairy
appeared to be helping the girl clean the sink, dancing
about in the powder and waving her magic wand.
Little specks of stardust seemed to fly from the end of
it until the whole kitchen was spotless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she finished.</p>
<p>Some of the people found it so. Questions were
asked about the properties set up to make the studio
look like a kitchen. The floor was a design of squares
painted on with water colors. It would be washed
away when the set was changed.</p>
<p>Others were beginning to act bored. Judy noticed
several women stopping to take mirrors out of their
purses and look at themselves critically. One of them
asked, &ldquo;Will we need stage makeup? I&rsquo;ve heard the
stars use plenty of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; replied the guide. &ldquo;We will appear as
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; wailed Clarissa. &ldquo;I look terrible. My
hair is dull. My hair is drab&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn her off, somebody!&rdquo; Pauline interrupted.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve heard that record before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has my head spinning like a record,&rdquo; declared
Judy. &ldquo;I hope I remember some of the things we&rsquo;ve
learned on this tour. A balopticon is one kind of
camera and a dolly is another&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the camera. It&rsquo;s the truck that&rsquo;s called a
dolly,&rdquo; Pauline corrected her. &ldquo;You see, it takes two
men to work it. That&rsquo;s the camera man up there on
the funny little seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he wearing earphones? Did the guide say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did say something about the men on the studio
floor hearing directions from the control room. It is
complicated,&rdquo; put in Flo. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be expected to
remember most of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, anyway, I know that big fishing-line thing is
the mike boom. If I remember that much, Irene won&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m too ignorant,&rdquo; Judy concluded. &ldquo;I wonder
how they keep all that equipment from showing on a
live TV show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide took time to explain it, telling them
how accurately the cameras had to be focused so that
the mike boom which dangled its microphone right
over the heads of the performers was always just out
of the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does look like a fishing line, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she
agreed. &ldquo;Are there any more questions before we go
up to the sound room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa started to ask something and then changed
her mind, saying, &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guide gave a little performance of her own to
demonstrate the sound effects. Rain was rice falling
on waxed paper. Fire was the crackle of cellophane.
There were blocks of wood for marching soldiers and
other sounds equally amazing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she announced, emerging from the
glassed-in sound room, &ldquo;we are ready to see ourselves
on television.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little ripple of anticipation went down the line
that now followed the uniformed guide to another
studio containing a pedestal camera and a television
set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a closed circuit,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Your friends
at home won&rsquo;t see you, but you will see yourselves
and each other. You will each have a chance to say a
few words&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will we say?&rdquo; Clarissa inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you questions. You just answer them. Most
of you are from out of town, I presume. People taking
these tours usually are. You, sir?&rdquo; She spoke to a tall
gentleman with a thick mustache. &ldquo;Step up here before
the camera and tell us a little about yourself. Can
you see yourself on the screen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled, showing white teeth that looked even
whiter as his face was framed in the TV set.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. I look good. I am here from Rio de Janeiro
on business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man talked about his business which was manufacturing
plastic caps. It was hard to understand him
because of his accent. The others taking the tour
waited their turns, standing along a wall at the side of
the room. As the line moved up, Clarissa became
more and more nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not show,&rdquo; she kept insisting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll show,&rdquo; Judy reassured her. &ldquo;You
see how clear the picture is. Everybody else shows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>

<p class="caption">As the line moved up, Clarissa became more and more nervous</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t show in the mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline turned to her in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you joking when you said that?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never more serious in my life,&rdquo; replied
Clarissa. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the truth. Once I really did look in a
mirror, and there was no reflection. I&rsquo;ve been afraid
of&mdash;of something ever since it happened. My brother
noticed it first and said, &lsquo;Clar, you don&rsquo;t show!&rsquo; He
always calls me Clar. It rhymes with jar the way he
says it. I thought he was teasing me, but then I
looked, and sure enough, my face didn&rsquo;t show at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the mirror broken?&rdquo; asked Flo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t broken. I&rsquo;m sure, because I noticed
my brother looking in it afterwards, and his reflection
was as plain as anything. My younger sisters looked,
too. They saw themselves all right. There are six of
us, including Mother and Daddy,&rdquo; Clarissa explained.
&ldquo;It was Mother&rsquo;s mirror. She still uses it. I was the
only one who didn&rsquo;t show. Mother laughed and said
I must be a changeling, but I didn&rsquo;t think it was funny.
It still scares me. How could a thing like that happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be an explanation for it,&rdquo; Judy replied.
Here was another mystery for her to solve. But, instead
of concentrating on it, her thoughts kept returning
to her hair. Would it look dull and drab on
television?</p>
<p>The brown-haired man Pauline and Flo thought
they knew stepped up before the camera and announced
that he was from Hollywood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder he didn&rsquo;t recognize me!&rdquo; Flo exclaimed.
&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the young man who works in our
office and yet he does look like him. Maybe he has a
twin brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a double. Lots of people have doubles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Judy, only a few people have them,&rdquo; Pauline
objected, and Judy had to agree with her. One of the
wonderful things about people, she thought, was
that no two of them were exactly alike. Even identical
twins could be told apart by their fingerprints, and
usually there were other important differences. Judy
found herself watching for individual characteristics
as, one by one, the people stepped before the camera.
A photograph of skyscrapers on the backdrop behind
them made it appear to be a sidewalk interview.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from out of town?&rdquo; was the question
most frequently asked by the guide.</p>
<p>Most of them were. Some came from as far away
as Brazil or Switzerland. Two were from Texas, and
two said they were from the state of Washington.
When Judy replied that she lived in Pennsylvania she
felt as if she were practically at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your hair looked lighter on TV,&rdquo; Flo told her
when she stepped back in line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I kept worrying for fear it
would look dark. I don&rsquo;t know why. Dark hair is
pretty. I like the color of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s drab&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,&rdquo; Judy stopped her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re next, Clarissa.
What&rsquo;s the matter? Are you afraid to go up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Clarissa admitted, suddenly all a-tremble.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Take a good look at yourself,&rdquo; advised
Pauline, giving her a little push.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unwilling and still trembling, Clarissa stepped up
before the camera. She stood in the exact spot where
Judy had been standing. The guide began to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re from West Virginia, aren&rsquo;t you? What
town? Look into the camera and tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long drawn-out wail from Clarissa interrupted
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am looking,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see anything!
What&rsquo;s the matter with me? Why don&rsquo;t I show?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />Impossible Answers</h2>
<p>An exclamation went up from the people taking
the tour. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s right. There isn&rsquo;t any picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that bright spot of light?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>She had never seen anything like it before. The
picture on the television screen seemed to be closing
in on all sides. Instead of Clarissa&rsquo;s face, an eerie,
wavering light danced before her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be something wrong with the set,&rdquo; the
guide began. &ldquo;Step back a moment, and I&rsquo;ll see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped. Clarissa&rsquo;s face had become waxy white.
She would have fallen if Judy hadn&rsquo;t rushed to her
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Judy said soothingly. &ldquo;Some little
technical thing probably went wrong&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, Judy. It wasn&rsquo;t that. I am a phantom. I saw
myself the way I really am. Oh, help me!&rdquo; wailed
Clarissa as she slumped forward and slipped to the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Judy gasped. &ldquo;I tried to hold her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Judy,&rdquo; Pauline told her. &ldquo;You did
save her from a hard fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ill. We must get her to the first-aid station
at once.&rdquo; The guide, obviously a little shaken herself,
took charge. Two of the men carried Clarissa to a
door with a red cross and the words: <span class="sc">FIRST AID</span>, lettered
on it. Here she was left with an efficient, white-uniformed
nurse who assured Judy that her friend
would be all right, but that she must rest for half an
hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we stay with her?&rdquo; asked Flo. &ldquo;I think she
was frightened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied the nurse, &ldquo;it might be better
for her to be alone until she&rsquo;s fully recovered from
the shock. What happened? Was the guide in any way
at fault?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Judy hastened to assure her. &ldquo;In fact, she was
very efficient. It was probably something technical.
I don&rsquo;t understand the inside workings of television
very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse smiled. &ldquo;Neither do I. The inside workings
of the human mind are even more mysterious.
This girl should see a doctor or a psychiatrist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-oo,&rdquo; came a sob from Clarissa.</p>
<p>The nurse quieted her, breaking a capsule for her to
inhale. She asked the girl for her name and address, but
all Clarissa said was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not real. I&rsquo;ll fade away altogether
pretty soon. Please, just leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s best.&rdquo; Quietly the nurse escorted
Judy, Pauline, and Flo into the next room where she
began to ask questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the girl&rsquo;s name is Clarissa Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy nodded, and the nurse wrote it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo; was her next question.</p>
<p>The three girls looked at each other in bewilderment.
&ldquo;She said West Virginia, didn&rsquo;t she? We don&rsquo;t
know the name of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll get the rest of the information
from her as soon as she&rsquo;s feeling better. Now,&rdquo; said
the nurse, &ldquo;if you will leave your names and tell me
where I can reach you, I think it will be all right for
you to go back and finish your tour. Give our patient
half an hour, and I think I can convince her she isn&rsquo;t
in any danger of fading away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We forgot to tell the nurse that Clarissa&rsquo;s father
is a minister,&rdquo; Judy said suddenly when they were
halfway down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he isn&rsquo;t. I still think she&rsquo;s putting on an act,&rdquo;
declared Pauline. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the sort that craves attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know what sort she is?&rdquo; Flo asked.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s practically a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to think of her as a friend,&rdquo; objected
Judy. &ldquo;Everybody craves attention in one way
or another. If she&rsquo;s in trouble, isn&rsquo;t it up to us to help
her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;We have helped her,&rdquo; Pauline reminded Judy. &ldquo;We
each gave her five dollars, didn&rsquo;t we? I should think
that was help enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe money isn&rsquo;t what she needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flo laughed at that. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t money what everybody
needs? Quit dreaming, Judy. Why do you think all
these people are rushing about like ants in an ant hill?
If it isn&rsquo;t to get money, it&rsquo;s to spend it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than that.&rdquo; Judy wanted to explain, but
the right words wouldn&rsquo;t come. They had just entered
the room where the closed circuit TV set was
being viewed by the tourists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it now,&rdquo; observed
Pauline. &ldquo;The picture is just as clear as ever. We&rsquo;ll
bring Clarissa back here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flo, who had not yet seen herself on TV, stepped
up before the camera. She frowned at her image
framed in the TV set against the background of tall
buildings. The picture was clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t scowled at yourself you would have
looked all right,&rdquo; Judy told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my hair looked dull&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Clarissa&rsquo;s complaint, not yours, Flo. I do
believe she&rsquo;s hypnotized you into saying it,&rdquo; declared
Pauline.</p>
<p>Judy wondered if that could be possible. Afterwards
she wished she had asked the guide what went
wrong with the picture when Clarissa fainted. For
when they went back to get her she did refuse to
come and see herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; Clarissa added, &ldquo;the tour is over, and
I&rsquo;m all right now. The nurse gave me some capsules
to break and inhale if I feel faint during Irene&rsquo;s show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Pauline began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you invited me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we did,&rdquo; Judy broke in. &ldquo;Irene is expecting
all four of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so good to me!&rdquo; exclaimed Clarissa. She
glanced about the small room with its first-aid equipment
as if in doubt about something. Then she said,
&ldquo;The nurse went out for a minute. We don&rsquo;t need to
wait for her. Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was glad to leave. There was something oppressive
in the air. The closed-in cubicle was left for
the next emergency patient. As soon as they were
outside in the wintry air, the color came back to
Clarissa&rsquo;s cheeks, and she appeared to be quite herself
again. Swirls of snow were still blowing about,
now hiding, now revealing the street ahead.</p>
<p>They stopped in a drugstore and had coffee and a
quick sandwich. As they were about to leave, Judy
remembered something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to buy a bottle of golden hair wash!&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, too,&rdquo; Flo said. &ldquo;This looks like as good a
place as any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golden hair wash,&rdquo; breathed Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it three bottles,&rdquo; Judy heard herself saying
to the druggist.</p>
<p>He regarded her curiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t going to use that stuff on your red
hair, are you?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Judy, feeling uncomfortable under
his puzzled gaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it. This is
the thirteenth bottle I&rsquo;ve sold in the last half hour.
Ordinarily the stuff doesn&rsquo;t sell too well. You have to
be careful how you use it. Follow the directions, and
don&rsquo;t let any of it get into your eyes or your mouth.
It will gradually change the color of your hair. Is that
what you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I want. I want to change everything
about me,&rdquo; declared Clarissa.</p>
<p>Hugging her bottle of shampoo as if it were a magic
potion, she followed the others out of the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll be beautiful,&rdquo; she kept saying. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll
be a golden girl too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flo agreed with her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have golden hair, too. It&rsquo;s
bound to make me look better. Don&rsquo;t you think so,
Judy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind blew harder. Judy could scarcely make
herself heard above the weird whistling noise it was
making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be Flo,&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look so
different without your pretty, brown hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will I be?&rdquo; Flo asked, glancing at Clarissa
just as the wind caught her scarf and sent it flapping.
&ldquo;Will people call me a changeling?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re laughing at me,&rdquo; Clarissa charged.
&ldquo;Well, you can joke if you want to, but I still have a
feeling I&rsquo;m not real. You must have felt there was
something different about me when you called me a
phantom friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were talking about the empty chair,&rdquo; Judy began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People say things sometimes without knowing why
they say them, and they turn out to be true,&rdquo; Clarissa
insisted. &ldquo;Mother didn&rsquo;t mean it when she called me
a changeling, either, but she made me feel like one.
You know&mdash;as if the real me is hidden somewhere
under this dull, drab hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your mother call it dull and drab?&rdquo; asked Flo.
&ldquo;Is that why you&rsquo;ve hypnotized the rest of us into
buying this golden hair wash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Hypnotized you? I thought it was the other
way around.&rdquo; Clarissa seemed genuinely distressed.
She turned to look at Flo, and at that moment the
thirteenth bottle of golden hair wash fell and broke,
spilling all over the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look what you made me do!&rdquo; With a sound
that was more of a sob than a laugh, Clarissa added,
&ldquo;Now I can never be a golden girl. I can never find
the really, truly me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />An Unfortunate Gift</h2>
<p>Judy acted on impulse. She thrust her own bottle
of shampoo into Clarissa&rsquo;s gloved hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it,&rdquo; she urged the surprised girl. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know why I bought it in the first place. Irene doesn&rsquo;t
need it. I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d never use it. She&rsquo;d probably
think I was out of my mind to buy it for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take mine, too. I don&rsquo;t like the looks of the stuff
when it&rsquo;s spilled. And I&rsquo;d be afraid to use it after
what that druggist said,&rdquo; declared Flo. &ldquo;I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Clarissa before Flo could finish. &ldquo;See
what it does to me before you condemn it. I&rsquo;ll be a
glamorous new person because of this shampoo. You
just wait and see what happens to me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Fear seized Judy. Suddenly she was afraid of what
would happen. Already she felt herself in the grip of
something she could neither explain nor understand.
Was Clarissa in its grip, too? The girl&rsquo;s mood had
changed so suddenly it was alarming. Had the gift of
two bottles of shampoo worked the transformation?
Judy considered it unlikely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed already. You don&rsquo;t need to change
the color of your hair,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s drab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t, Clarissa. I don&rsquo;t know what makes
you keep saying that. It&rsquo;s just your imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled impishly and tossed her head. A
white scarf covered her hair except for a few stray
wisps that were blowing in the wind. The ends of her
scarf fluttered like white wings behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do have an imagination,&rdquo; she admitted as if revealing
a secret she had meant to keep. &ldquo;Sometimes it
plays tricks on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it was when you thought the cashier
stole your twenty dollars,&rdquo; Pauline said. &ldquo;You just
imagined you gave it to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; Clarissa seemed ready to admit it. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t suppose the wind could have picked the money
out of my hand, do you? It&rsquo;s fierce today, isn&rsquo;t it? It
wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me a bit if it picked me up and
carried me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can just see you being swept up into the clouds
with that white scarf trailing behind you. Like the
witch who rides through the sky on Hallowe&rsquo;en.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the thirteenth fairy in Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; replied
Clarissa, and she was laughing, too. &ldquo;It was always
my favorite fairy tale. I can hardly wait to see
Irene&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t playing the part of Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; Flo
interrupted. &ldquo;She just introduces the show and sings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. She told us. Sleeping Beauty is being
played by a guest star, Francine Dow. I&rsquo;ve seen her on
television, and she&rsquo;s lovely. I wonder if she uses golden
hair wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she doesn&rsquo;t. Her hair is dark,&rdquo; Flo said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s light,&rdquo; Pauline contradicted.</p>
<p>Pauline and Flo were actually arguing about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what color it is when we reach the
studio,&rdquo; Judy told them, &ldquo;not that it matters. I&rsquo;m
tired of all this talk about hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much farther is it?&rdquo; asked Clarissa. &ldquo;It seems
to me we&rsquo;ve been walking forever in this wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; announced Pauline as they rounded
the next corner. &ldquo;See the sign, <span class="sc">GOLDEN GIRL SHOW</span>.
The theater looks a little sad, doesn&rsquo;t it? They&rsquo;ve
turned an old movie house into a TV studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was eager to see how the cameras and other
technical equipment were arranged inside the theater
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s warm, thank goodness!&rdquo; she exclaimed as they
entered, showing their pass to a man in the lobby. He
waved a tired hand toward the left side of the theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re early. Take any four seats,&rdquo; he said with
an uninterested drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t we get a chance to see the dressing rooms?&rdquo;
Clarissa asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always wanted to see the dressing
rooms of the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see them afterwards, I guess. I wonder where
the control room is. I think I&rsquo;ll look around and see
if I can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Judy!&rdquo; said Pauline. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we
should go exploring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Judy didn&rsquo;t see any reason why she shouldn&rsquo;t
leave her seat if the others saved it for her. She shook
the snow from her coat and left it there so people
would know the seat was taken.</p>
<p>Most of the folding seats had been removed from
the theater to make room for the TV equipment.
Those that remained were directly under the balcony.
Judy hesitated a moment, looking around. Then she
walked down the aisle between the rows of seats until
she came to what was called the studio floor. Immediately
she recognized the different kinds of cameras
and microphones. The big mike boom, mounted on
its three-wheeled platform, stood to one side. So did
the dolly, its funny little up-in-the-air seat now empty.
Judy gazed at it for a moment. Then she turned
around. There on the balcony was the glass-enclosed
control room with its monitors and flashing lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned more than I thought I did on that tour,&rdquo;
she told the others when she returned to her seat.
&ldquo;The control room is just over our heads on what
used to be the balcony of the old theater. There&rsquo;s a
movie on this channel now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been watching it. Probably it&rsquo;s being shown
for the second time in this theatre,&rdquo; Pauline said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
so ancient I&rsquo;m sure it must have been one of the pictures
shown here before this building was made over
into a TV studio.&rdquo; She pointed. &ldquo;See it! They have
another one of those monitors suspended from a beam
just over the middle aisle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;We can
watch Irene&rsquo;s show on TV at the same time we&rsquo;re
seeing it on the stage. Oh, there she is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy broke off with this exclamation as the people
in the surrounding seats began to clap. She joined
them, clapping so enthusiastically that her hands
smarted. Under the blazing overhead lights, Irene
looked lovelier than ever. She had appeared from
somewhere behind the star-studded curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, everybody!&rdquo; she said brightly when the clapping
had subsided. &ldquo;Welcome to the Golden Girl
show. In the half hour before we go on the air there&rsquo;s
time to make you acquainted with some of the people
important to the show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one they were introduced. Irene knew all
the technicians and called them by their first names&mdash;the
manager with his walkie-talkie, the boom man,
the camera men and their helpers. One was adjusting
the seat on the dolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d get dizzy up there,&rdquo; Judy whispered.</p>
<p>She had never before realized how many other people
besides actors were needed to put on a TV show.
The sound man, the lighting engineer, the director and
his assistants in the control room&mdash;each had his own
part to play.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;You people out there are part of the show, too,&rdquo;
Irene continued. &ldquo;When the hands of the studio clock
point to seven we will go on the air. In the meantime,
I&rsquo;d like to present four of my best friends to the
studio audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means us. How sweet of her!&rdquo; exclaimed
Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, too?&rdquo; asked Clarissa, holding back a little as
the others left their seats. &ldquo;She can&rsquo;t mean me. I only
met her today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy laughed. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take Irene long to decide
who her friends are. Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />A Hidden Danger</h2>
<p>The area between the first row of seats and the
Golden Girl set was filled with a complicated maze
of technical equipment. Judy nearly tripped over a
trailing cable on the way to join Irene on the studio
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; Judy urged Clarissa a second time.</p>
<p>Irene was waiting for them. She seemed completely
at home on the studio floor, moving through and
around the pieces of equipment as easily as she
moved about in her kitchen at home. The girls were
introduced. It was all very informal and nice. Afterwards
the floor manager suggested a quick tour behind
the scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you want to show your friends around,
Irene,&rdquo; he said with an understanding twinkle in his
eyes. &ldquo;You have ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Si. I won&rsquo;t take more than that. This
doesn&rsquo;t compare with Radio City, of course,&rdquo; Irene
apologized, turning to Judy, &ldquo;but perhaps I can show
you something you haven&rsquo;t already seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the dressing rooms?&rdquo; Judy thought of
Clarissa&rsquo;s request and explained that they hadn&rsquo;t seen
them on their other tour. &ldquo;It was interrupted,&rdquo; she
began and then stopped as there was too much to tell
in ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did that happen?&rdquo; Irene asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll explain it later,&rdquo; Judy promised. &ldquo;Is there
time to see the dressing rooms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re small and crowded tonight, but I guess
we can take a quick peek,&rdquo; Irene agreed. &ldquo;This way,
girls! Be careful and don&rsquo;t fall over anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dusty, cluttered space behind the glittering
curtain was a disappointment to Clarissa. Judy could
tell by the look on her face. Backgrounds were folded
one against the other. Props waited to be placed inside
make-believe rooms that were nothing but painted
canvas stretched on wooden racks. Beyond, a narrow
corridor separated two rows of doors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will we see Francine Dow?&rdquo; Clarissa asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Pauline looked at Flo and said pointedly, &ldquo;We had
a little argument over the color of her hair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can settle it when you see her,&rdquo; Irene told
them as they entered the crowded dressing room. The
girls who were to be good fairies on the program
were fluttering about in their filmy dresses. Two of
them were seated before a long dressing table putting
on make-up that gave their faces a yellowish tinge. A
third girl, made up to look like an old woman, was
dipping a sponge into a bowl of green stuff and then
applying it to her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be the witch,&rdquo; Pauline whispered to
Judy. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she <i>scare</i> you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her hair is green, too,&rdquo; Flo observed with a giggle.
&ldquo;How about washing your hair with <i>green</i> hair wash,
Clarissa? You said you&rsquo;d do anything to get on TV.
Would you play the part of an old witch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to make
myself any uglier than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously the witch could hear the whispered conversation
behind her. Making her voice sound old and
cackling, she said without turning her head, &ldquo;So you
think I&rsquo;m ugly, my pretty? Wait until you see the
curse I put on the child! I hope I don&rsquo;t scare any little
kiddies who may be watching&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scare me,&rdquo; Clarissa interrupted. &ldquo;I can see
your face in the mirror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad luck to look into a mirror over anyone&rsquo;s
shoulder,&rdquo; the witch warned her. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you go
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Clarissa, her eyes still fixed on the
mirrored face of the witch, was backing out into the
corridor toward a closed door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that another dressing room, Irene?&rdquo; asked Flo.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t see your guest star, Francine Dow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you know her?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
wouldn&rsquo;t. She&rsquo;s appeared in so many different roles. I
don&rsquo;t even know what color her hair is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<div class="img" id="img002">
<img src="images/img002.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="266" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Irene confessed. &ldquo;She
wore a black wig in the <i>Mikado</i> and looked quite like
a Japanese schoolgirl. She is late, but I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll
be here in time to play the part of the Sleeping Beauty.
She doesn&rsquo;t appear until the show is half over. Maybe
she planned to be late so she would have the dressing
room to herself. We had to rehearse without her this
afternoon,&rdquo; Irene continued, a worried note creeping
into her voice, &ldquo;but she assured me, over the telephone,
that she knows the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The play would be ruined without Sleeping Beauty,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Clarissa asked. &ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t brought
bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you haven&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s just a silly superstition,&rdquo;
Irene declared. &ldquo;Actually, it makes an actress
nervous to have anyone look over her shoulder when
she&rsquo;s applying make-up, so she&rsquo;s apt to tell you it
brings bad luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy wondered if she did. &ldquo;You say this isn&rsquo;t a
dressing room? What is behind this other door?&rdquo;
she asked curiously.</p>
<p>She could hear voices that made her even more
curious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s forbidden!&rdquo; someone was almost shouting.
&ldquo;This thing is still in the experimental stage. It
may be as dangerous as an atom bomb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what all the excitement is about. This
is our film storage room,&rdquo; Irene explained, tapping on
the door before she opened it. &ldquo;Most of our programs
are on film or on kinescope, and they&rsquo;re kept here.
Mine is one of the few live shows that originate in
this studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was calm as she entered the small room that
was still charged with emotion. Rows of shelves and
pigeonholes lined the walls. Two men were glaring
at each other across a high desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like a couple of roosters ready for a
fight,&rdquo; Irene told them amiably. &ldquo;Can you forget
your differences long enough to meet some friends of
mine? This is Mr. Lenz, our projectionist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; the older man said in an agitated
voice as he was introduced to the four girls.</p>
<p>Judy recognized the younger man as the one with
the unruly lock of brown hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were on the tour with us!&rdquo; she exclaimed in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> from our agency! Why did you tell the
guide you were from Hollywood?&rdquo; Flo demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Usually,&rdquo; said the brown-haired young man with
an easy smile, &ldquo;I tell people what they want to hear.
You want me to be Blake van Pelt, a native New
Yorker. Yes, my dear Miss Garner, that is my name.
I already know yours because, you see, I do work on
Madison Avenue just as you do&mdash;and for the same
agency, so I think we understand each other. The
guide, another charming young lady, wanted me to
be from out of town so I gave her a line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say line or lie?&rdquo; Flo was angry now and
justifiably so, Judy thought. Without in the least understanding
what was going on, she felt herself on
the side of truth. Something Clarissa had said back in
the restaurant flashed across her mind. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anybody
in New York care about the truth?&rdquo; Apparently
there were a number of people who did, among them
the white-haired projectionist, Mr. Lenz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word is lie,&rdquo; he said icily. &ldquo;So you tell people
what they want to hear, do you, Mr. van Pelt? I
think the purpose of your agency is to make them
dissatisfied with what they have so they&rsquo;ll buy what
you have to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man flashed another smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve put it very well. Advertising is a selling
job. We&rsquo;re not in business to entertain people or to
make them contented as they sit in their living rooms
watching TV. Contented people are like cows. It&rsquo;s
our job to make them discontented. That&rsquo;s no crime,
is it, Mr. Lenz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but this is! None of the other networks allow
it. I have my orders from the director of this program,&rdquo;
the projectionist declared. &ldquo;Now, suppose
you take your film out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Blake van Pelt picked up a round gray can
about an inch thick and a foot across, and sauntered
out of the room. Did it contain a roll of film or something
more sinister? Judy found herself wondering
what Mr. Lenz meant when he had shouted, &ldquo;It may
be as dangerous as an atom bomb!&rdquo; After he had
calmed down a little the projectionist opened a can
similar to the one the younger man had taken away
with him and said to Irene, &ldquo;This is the ad we&rsquo;ll run
on your show, Mrs. Meredith. It&rsquo;s for a tooth paste
approved by dentists, and features a cute little girl
cleaning her teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may inspire little Judy,&rdquo; Irene began and then
stopped. &ldquo;What was the other ad?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Why
were you so angry about it, Mr. Lenz?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old man&rsquo;s temper,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind
me, and good luck with your show tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />The Witch&rsquo;s Curse</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need more than luck if anything is wrong in
the film department,&rdquo; Irene said later when they were
back on the studio floor.</p>
<p>She was worried about something. Judy could see
that. She took the seat Pauline was saving for her.
Flo was already seated next to Pauline with Clarissa
occupying the chair next to the aisle. An usher was
seating people in every available place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No empty seats! No empty seats!&rdquo; he kept on repeating
as the crowd surged in.</p>
<p>Two pedestal cameras were stationed directly in
front of the curtain where Irene stood waiting. At
one side, mounted on a large three-wheeled platform,
rode the man who operated the mike boom. The man
on the dolly was sitting in his funny little seat with
the operator ready to raise or lower him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>The hands of the big studio clock over the exit
door moved slowly toward the hour of seven. The
camera men and the boom man, all wearing headphones,
stood ready before their equipment. The floor
manager also waited for the directions he would receive
through his headpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; asked the announcer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set,&rdquo; Irene replied, smiling.</p>
<p>Did Judy imagine it, or was her smile a little forced?
&ldquo;Nothing must go wrong,&rdquo; Judy caught herself almost
praying. &ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t let anything go wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One minute ... stand by!&rdquo; sounded over the
loudspeaker.</p>
<p>Were the other girls as tense as she was? Judy found
it hard to read the expressions on their faces. The
lights over the Golden Girl set made everything else
look dim.</p>
<p>The television set suspended over the middle aisle
was showing the end commercial from the previous
show. As soon as it was over red lights flashed above
the exit doors, and Judy knew Golden Girl was on
the air. The announcer stepped to one side, out of
camera range, and clapped his hands as a signal for
the audience to clap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she lovely?&rdquo; whispered someone in the audience
as the bright spotlight shone down on Irene.
Quick tears came to Judy&rsquo;s eyes as Irene began to
sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>My own golden girl, there is one, only one,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Who has eyes like the stars and hair like the sun.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>It was her theme song. Judy&rsquo;s thoughts took her
back to the first time she had heard it on a roof garden
while she danced with Dale Meredith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irene is a golden girl tonight,&rdquo; he had said, and
from then on her happiness had become his chief concern.
Judy thought of him now, at home in their
new Long Island house, probably holding a sleepy
baby on his knee as he listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Mommy,&rdquo; he would be saying to little
Judy. Or perhaps there was no need to say it. By
now Judy&rsquo;s little namesake must be well acquainted
with the mysteries of TV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better acquainted than I am,&rdquo; Judy thought ruefully.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t overcome the fear that something
would go wrong with the show. Little Judy wouldn&rsquo;t
see the microphone dangling over her mother&rsquo;s head.
She wouldn&rsquo;t see the cameras being moved in like
menacing monsters. She wouldn&rsquo;t know, as Judy did,
that somewhere back in the film room there had been
something &ldquo;as dangerous as an atom bomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Peter were here I could ask him about it,&rdquo; Judy
thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advertising is over, and the show is about to
begin,&rdquo; Pauline whispered.</p>
<p>Judy glimpsed the little girl cleaning her teeth on
the TV set. Since the advertising was all on film, it
did not seem to interrupt the play that was now beginning.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she heard Clarissa whisper. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the palace
scene with the king and queen. I wonder if that&rsquo;s a real
baby in the crib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the television screen the king and queen seemed
to be crooning over a real baby, but Judy suspected
the crib was empty. The throne room was only a
painted scene on a wooden frame with a few props in
the foreground to make it appear real. The spotlight
rested on the royal family for a moment and then
moved over to Irene. Dressed as one of the fairies, she
sang to summon the others:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Fairies! Fairies! Now appear</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Bringing gifts for baby dear.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>One will give a pretty face,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Two a body full of grace,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Three the love light in her eyes.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Four will make her kind and wise.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>In danced the fairies bringing their gifts and waving
their wands over the crib. On the screen flecks of stardust
could be seen swirling about. Remembering the
tour, Judy knew how this effect was achieved.</p>
<p>More gifts were bestowed on the little princess as
the next seven fairies danced in. Irene&rsquo;s song was as
beautiful and tender as a lullaby. A film strip of a
real baby made it seem as if the audience had been
given a glimpse of the little princess in her crib.</p>
<p>It was almost too real when the witch whirled in.
A gasp went up from the audience as she interrupted
the fairy song with a hoarse shriek:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>I was not invited. Why?</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>For punishment I&rsquo;ll make her</i> die!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, oh, no!&rdquo; Judy almost forgot it was a play and
found herself crying out with the fairies. All had given
their gifts except Irene, who was playing the part of
the twelfth fairy.</p>
<p>The queen, rising from her throne, began to explain
that there were only twelve golden plates for feasting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why you weren&rsquo;t invited, dear, good
fairy,&rdquo; she said to the witch. &ldquo;Please take away your
curse.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>For shame!&rdquo; cried the witch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it worse!</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>She shall live to age fifteen,</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>But she shall</i> never <i>be a queen.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>While spinning she shall prick her hand.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>There&rsquo;ll be no cure in all the land.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have pity! Have pity!&rdquo; cried the poor queen,
wringing her hands and sobbing so realistically that
Judy almost cried with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will have every spinning wheel destroyed,&rdquo; the
king declared. &ldquo;This cruel pronouncement must not
come to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you help us, dear fairies?&rdquo; sobbed the queen.</p>
<p>They drooped like wilted flowers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo;
one after another of them replied. &ldquo;She is not one of
us. She is a witch. Her powers are greater than ours,
but we will try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that they began dancing around the witch, trying
to touch her with their wands. The music played
wildly as the witch whirled and danced, always eluding
them and finally dancing off the set.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; exclaimed the king. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s left her
curse on all of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You good fairies, is there nothing you can do?&rdquo;
The queen turned to the dancers with a pleading
gesture. Eleven of them shook their heads. Irene, the
twelfth fairy, danced into the spotlight and began to
sing:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>A twelfth gift I have yet to give.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The princess shall not die, but live.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>A fairy mist will change the spell</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>From death to sleep. She shall sleep well</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>A hundred years. Yes, all shall sleep.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Change, curse, from death to slumber deep!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>With a wave of her wand, Irene stepped out of
camera range and stood smiling and bowing to the
studio audience as the curtain descended. Judy forgot
to look at the advertising. She was seeing only Irene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the star of this show. Francine Dow can&rsquo;t be
any more wonderful than she was,&rdquo; Judy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was Pauline worried, too? Clarissa was heard to
whisper, &ldquo;Oh dear, I left my two bottles of shampoo
back there in the witch&rsquo;s dressing room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can get them after the show,&rdquo; Flo whispered
back. She turned to Pauline and said something about
the commercial. Several people left their seats during
the intermission, but Judy stayed where she was. She
didn&rsquo;t want to miss anything.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>As soon as the commercial was over, the cameras
were again on Irene. She stood in front of the curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The king has issued a decree commanding that
every spindle in the kingdom be burnt, but it is no
use,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;Fifteen years have passed. The
witch&rsquo;s curse is almost forgotten, but look what&rsquo;s
hidden away in a dusty old room at the top of the
castle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The curtain opened on the set she had described.
There, before an old spinning wheel, sat the witch
spinning flax. For a time nothing was heard except
the whir of the spinning wheel. Then a door opened,
and a lovely young girl tiptoed in. Judy breathed a
sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Francine Dow! Her hair is golden just as I
knew it was,&rdquo; Pauline whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be a wig,&rdquo; Flo whispered back.</p>
<p>The princess stood behind the old witch, not saying
a word until she turned her head. Then, appearing
frightened, she said, &ldquo;Good day, my good lady, what
are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am spinning,&rdquo; said the witch, nodding her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing is that which twists round so merrily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a spindle. Want to try it, my pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the same evil voice Judy had heard back in
the dressing room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The princess did sound afraid as she took the spindle.
Her long golden hair fell almost to her waist. Were
those real tears in her eyes when she pricked her finger?
She fell, almost immediately, in an undramatic
pose with her face turned away from the audience.
The witch, chuckling softly to herself, began to
chant:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>My curse is done. The sleep of death</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Shall take away the princess&rsquo; breath!</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Judy drew a breath of her own that was almost a
gasp. She knew the old fairy story by heart, and yet
there was a moment when the play seemed so real
that she wasn&rsquo;t at all sure the curse wouldn&rsquo;t come
true.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />Into the Mist</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it spooky?&rdquo; Pauline whispered, breaking the
spell that was upon Judy. The theater was so dark
she couldn&rsquo;t see her friend, but she could hear her
voice. She was about to answer when the sound of a
wailing siren reached her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>that</i>?&rdquo; she questioned fearfully.</p>
<p>Pauline touched her arm. &ldquo;Judy! You&rsquo;re all goose-flesh,&rdquo;
she whispered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only an ambulance. Probably
there was an accident outside. But don&rsquo;t worry
about it. We&rsquo;re safe enough in here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we are.&rdquo; Judy had thought, for just a
fleeting moment, that something might have happened
back in the film room. Maybe an explosion or a fire.
But common sense told her Pauline was right. Her
attention was drawn back to the set where the fairies
were now singing:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>The witch! The witch! Her curse came true.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Pray tell us, what can fairies do?</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my pretties!&rdquo; chuckled the witch. She
nodded her head so that the green hair fell in straggly
wisps across her ugly face and repeated, &ldquo;Nothing,
my pretties. You can do nothing at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so! Not so!&rdquo; cried all the fairies, rushing at
her in a wild dance, their feet flying faster and faster
as the music increased in tempo.</p>
<p>Judy and her friends sat in rapt attention as did the
entire audience. The siren outside could still be heard
wailing above the music, but nobody paid much attention
to it. Irene, leading her train of fairies, drove
the witch into the wings and returned to where the
princess had fallen.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>She only sleeps. She is not dead.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>We&rsquo;ll take her to her royal bed</i>,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>the fairies sang softly. Making cradles of their arms,
they lifted the sleeping princess and carried her to
another set where she was placed in a canopied bed
to sleep for a hundred years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she beautiful?&rdquo; Judy whispered. &ldquo;She
looks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>&ldquo;Watch!&rdquo; Pauline interrupted as the cameras turned
quickly on another set showing the kitchen of the
castle. Here the cook fell asleep just as she was raising
her hand to box the ears of the kitchen boy. In still
another room the king and queen fell asleep on their
thrones. Finally the audience was given a glimpse of
the castle itself. It was only a background painting
pulled down to hide the various sets, but it looked real
enough on the television screen. Irene, standing in
front of it, waved her wand and began to chant:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>Arise, oh misty vapors, rise</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>To hide from all beneath the skies</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The place where Sleeping Beauty lies.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; whispered Judy. &ldquo;Now I know why everything
is so misty. Steam is being blown from a big
black kettle over there to the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mist was now very dense. A fan was blowing
it across the set. When it cleared away the castle had
changed. A thick growth of weeds and brush made
it seem as if a hundred years had passed during the
brief pause for the commercial.</p>
<p>All this time Irene had been standing to the left of
the set. She introduced the prince, now seen in a
puzzled pose before the forsaken castle.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;A lovely castle now appears.</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>The mist has hidden it for years.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Parting the thorny bushes, he made his way toward
it. Suddenly, to Judy&rsquo;s surprise, the whole background
scene went up like a window shade, revealing the
rooms inside the castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Sleeping Beauty again! Isn&rsquo;t she lovely?&rdquo;
a voice behind Judy whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so young looking!&rdquo; another whispered. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
it wonderful that Francine Dow can still play the part
of a fifteen-year-old girl?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>The face of the actress was turned a little away
from the viewers. A veil covered it. She lay as still
as death until the prince lifted the veil and kissed her.
Then quickly, almost too quickly, it seemed to Judy,
the play ended and Irene was before the cameras singing
her closing song. She sang it all the way through.
When it was finished, she blew a kiss to the children
in the audience, adding, &ldquo;And here&rsquo;s one for you,
Judykins.&rdquo; Little Judy was always Judykins to her
adoring young mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francine Dow wasn&rsquo;t really the star. Irene was,&rdquo;
declared Judy as the red lights flashed off. Almost
immediately the prop men began dismantling the set.
Fairyland backgrounds disappeared. Cameras were
pushed aside. The magic spell that had held the audience
was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Clarissa?&rdquo; Pauline Faulkner asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Judy looked around for the girl they had met in
the restaurant, but she was nowhere in sight. The
seat next to Flo was vacant. Judy tried to think when
she had last seen Clarissa or heard her speak. A shivery
feeling came over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see her leave?&rdquo; Pauline was asking
Florence Garner.</p>
<p>Flo shook her head. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t looking at anything
except the play,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it beautiful
when that fairy mist covered the castle and made it
vanish?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Judy waved her hand in front of Flo&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;The
play&rsquo;s over. Come back from fairyland,&rdquo; she told her.
&ldquo;Clarissa has vanished. You were sitting right beside
her. You must have seen her when she left her seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t leave it. Anyway, not that I noticed,&rdquo;
Flo protested. &ldquo;Maybe she was a phantom after all.
Maybe she disappeared into the mist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she did, she disappeared with the money we
lent her,&rdquo; Pauline declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; This statement brought Flo out
of her trancelike state. She stared at the empty seat
and then at Pauline. &ldquo;Well, what do you know?&rdquo; she
said at last. &ldquo;I think all four of us, including Irene,
have been played for suckers. We should have known
better than to trust a stranger. We don&rsquo;t even know
where she lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she was a phony. What do you think,
Judy?&rdquo; asked Pauline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Judy declared. &ldquo;Clarissa was
our friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our phantom friend,&rdquo; Pauline reminded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is sort of weird, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed Judy. &ldquo;We
called her a phantom and then she&mdash;well, she just
vanished. I can&rsquo;t think how or where. Was she there
when we heard that siren, Flo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What siren?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently Flo had been so engrossed in the show
that she hadn&rsquo;t heard it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an ambulance we heard outside the theater
right after the witch put her curse on Sleeping Beauty.
An ambulance!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed, a new possibility
dawning upon her. &ldquo;Do you suppose Clarissa&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; Pauline interrupted. &ldquo;She was in
here watching the show, not outside on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/img003.jpg" alt="&ldquo;Who was in that ambulance?&rdquo; Judy inquired" width="500" height="786" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Who was in that ambulance?&rdquo; Judy inquired</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; Judy objected. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
know how long her seat has been vacant. She could
have slipped outside, for some reason, and been hurt
in an accident. Come on, girls! We have to find out
for sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grabbing their coats, they hurried outside to see
what had happened. They were just too late. The
ambulance with its wailing siren had already disappeared
down the street. At the curb a taxicab with
its rear fender smashed in was waiting to be towed
away. The crowd that had gathered around the scene
of the accident was beginning to thin. Judy spied a
policeman and rushed over to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find our friend. We think she may have
left the theater and been hurt or something. Who was
in that ambulance?&rdquo; she inquired all in one breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />The Wrong Direction</h2>
<p>Judy knew a moment of panic. When she tried to
describe Clarissa all she could remember was her hair.
She called it honey colored while Pauline and Flo
described it as dark blond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was pretty,&rdquo; they all agreed. &ldquo;She looked
a little like&mdash;well, like Francine Dow. She&rsquo;s the guest
star who played Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; Judy added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t that pretty,&rdquo; Flo objected quickly. &ldquo;Her
hair was dull, and she had a rather drab look about
her. She was young&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How young?&rdquo; the policeman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;The woman they took away in the ambulance
can&rsquo;t be your missing friend if that&rsquo;s the way it is,&rdquo;
the policeman said reassuringly. &ldquo;No one could call
her sixteen. Besides, she was hurt on her way to the
theater&mdash;not coming away from it. The taxi driver
says she kept after him to hurry. He turned the corner
too fast and skidded into another car. Fortunately,
no one in the second vehicle was hurt. But here&rsquo;s the
cab driver,&rdquo; he ended abruptly. &ldquo;He can tell you
about it himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was introduced to the cab driver, who was
a little shaken up, but not hurt. More than anything
else, he seemed concerned about his passenger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friend of yours?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>Judy didn&rsquo;t know what to say. Was Clarissa a friend
or wasn&rsquo;t she? Had she deceived them as Pauline and
Flo seemed to think? It was Pauline who described
the missing girl and took down the name of the hospital
where the victim of the accident was taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t have been Clarissa. She was going in
the wrong direction,&rdquo; Flo told Pauline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did she hail your cab?&rdquo; Judy asked finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand Central Station,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d
just arrived in town and had to get to the theater in
a hurry. She didn&rsquo;t say why. Just gave me the address
and a big tip and told me to step on it as she was
already late&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly was if she expected to see the Sleeping
Beauty show. She&rsquo;d already missed the best part
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the witch dance?&rdquo; the cab driver
asked. &ldquo;She said something about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else did she say?&rdquo; Judy asked eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t listen much,&rdquo; the cab driver
confessed. &ldquo;I got my own problems. If this dame don&rsquo;t
come to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she badly hurt?&rdquo; Pauline interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out like a light. Couldn&rsquo;t give her name or anything.
I wish you girls did know her. It would be a
help. She was what I&rsquo;d call the theatrical type,&rdquo; the
cab driver continued. &ldquo;Older than you, but sort of
young looking&mdash;if you get what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What color was your passenger&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>The cab driver&rsquo;s answer startled her. &ldquo;Red,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;But not natural looking like yours. Think
you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s funny she mentioned the
witch dance, though,&rdquo; Flo said thoughtfully as the
three girls turned away. &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any truth in that
story Clarissa told us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline broke in with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t entertaining the idea that she might
really be a changeling, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it did frighten her when that witch
whirled in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that? You know she was sitting
beside you then?&rdquo; Pauline questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember it, too,&rdquo; put in Judy. &ldquo;I heard her say
she&rsquo;d left her two bottles of shampoo back there on
the witch&rsquo;s dressing table. Maybe she went backstage
after them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she went anywhere,&rdquo; Pauline said grimly, &ldquo;it
was for the reason I mentioned. She had our twenty
dollars, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;She said her father is a minister. I&rsquo;ll bet he is&mdash;not!&rdquo;
scoffed Flo. &ldquo;And Irene was telling me she didn&rsquo;t think
some advertising was honest! I wonder what she&rsquo;ll say
when she hears that our phantom friend disappeared
with the money we lent her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Flo, maybe she didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy protested.
&ldquo;Maybe she&rsquo;s back there in the theater looking for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That could be exactly where she is,&rdquo; agreed Pauline.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask Irene if she knows what happened to
her. I&rsquo;m sure our phantom friend didn&rsquo;t disappear into
the mist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy shivered at the way she said it. Remembering
the film storage room and the secret it held, anything
seemed possible. A real chill went through her
as they reentered the theater. The overhead lights
had been turned off, and the seats were all empty.
The cameras, idle now, looked more like monsters
than ever in the semidarkness. Most of the technicians
had gone home, but there was some activity
backstage where props were being put away. Voices
came from the dressing room. Irene was saying, &ldquo;I
wonder where they went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went outside if it&rsquo;s us you&rsquo;re wondering
about,&rdquo; replied Judy, popping in at the door. Her
entrance was so sudden that Irene jumped. The witch,
who was just removing her green make-up, dropped
her artificial nose. Pauline and Flo laughed, but their
faces sobered when they attempted to describe the
accident and their fears for Clarissa.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;We thought at first she might have taken a cab,
but the cab was coming from Grand Central terminal
and it had a redheaded woman in it. She was taken to
the hospital&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure it wasn&rsquo;t Clarissa?&rdquo; Irene interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not sure of anything,&rdquo; Flo replied with a
shiver. &ldquo;Clarissa is a strange girl. One minute she was
there beside me, and the next time I looked she was
gone. She probably sneaked out with the money we
lent her. I was under the spell of the play and didn&rsquo;t
see her leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how good you were,&rdquo; Irene said to the
girl who had played the part of the witch. With her
make-up removed, Judy could see that she was quite
an ordinary-looking person. Her cackling voice, too,
had been an act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people enjoy being frightened,&rdquo; the girl said.
&ldquo;But I hope I didn&rsquo;t upset your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa was not in the dressing room. Neither were
the two bottles of shampoo she claimed she had left
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must have taken them. Did you see her come
back here?&rdquo; Judy asked.</p>
<p>Irene shook her head. &ldquo;I thought she was out there
with you watching the play. I looked for you afterwards.
I wanted to introduce you to Francine Dow,
but her aunt hurried her away as soon as we went
off the air. I&rsquo;m not sure, but I don&rsquo;t think she was
quite well. Maybe she had a sore throat or something.
She didn&rsquo;t sing to the prince&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she supposed to?&rdquo; Pauline interrupted to ask.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the end. I sang my whole theme song to
fill in. Was it very noticeable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was beautiful, Irene. <i>You</i> were the star,&rdquo; Judy
declared warmly. &ldquo;Francine Dow played her part
well, of course, but I liked best the part where you
danced around the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it look like a real baby in the crib? It wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
Irene explained. &ldquo;It was only one of little Judy&rsquo;s dolls.
She knew we were going to use it. I told her we&rsquo;d
make it look like a real baby, but she didn&rsquo;t understand
about the film strip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she think her doll came to life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. When she&rsquo;s older I&rsquo;ll explain it. To her
television is a magic box where just about anything
can happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy thought about this a minute. The thought
troubled her. Anything? She had a feeling something
had happened&mdash;something she didn&rsquo;t like at all. The
film storage room was searched but yielded no clue
to the disappearance of Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing dangerous here, is there?&rdquo; asked
Judy, remembering the argument between the projectionist
and the man from Flo&rsquo;s agency.</p>
<p>Irene opened one of the waffle-shaped cans to show
her the roll of film inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a spot commercial for the golden hair
wash people,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t call that dangerous,
even though young girls who use it would
look so much lovelier with their own natural shade
of hair.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that. I&rsquo;m not sure just what I did
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The can of film looked innocent enough, but the
fear that had gripped Judy stayed with her. Mr. Lenz
had been justifiably angry, and the danger, whatever
it was, had been real.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />On the Train</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll just have to go home and forget
Clarissa,&rdquo; Pauline said finally after they had searched
the whole theater and questioned everybody&mdash;technicians
as well as actors who were still there in the cast.
Some had already left, but those who remained could
tell them nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She fainted before,&rdquo; Judy remembered.</p>
<p>Irene heard, for the first time, how Clarissa had
looked into a mirror and seen no reflection. &ldquo;And
then,&rdquo; Flo went on telling her, &ldquo;something went
wrong with that closed circuit TV set where we were
supposed to see our pictures, and she didn&rsquo;t show. That
was when she fainted. We took her to the first aid
room and then went back and finished our tour. The
TV set was all right. All the rest of us showed. We
forgot to ask the guide if she knew what went wrong
with it. Clarissa wouldn&rsquo;t go back there. She was
afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo; asked Irene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she wasn&rsquo;t real, I guess. I&rsquo;m beginning to
be afraid of it myself,&rdquo; Flo admitted. &ldquo;The doorman
said nobody left the show early, and nobody left by
the stage entrance except a few people who were in
the cast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francine Dow was one of them, wasn&rsquo;t she? What
about her aunt?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;You said she left with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. I forgot about her,&rdquo; Irene admitted.
&ldquo;She left by the stage entrance, too. I know what
you&rsquo;re thinking, Judy, but she was an old lady. Well,
anyway, middle-aged. She was a plump, motherly
looking woman with gray hair. I noticed her earlier
in the studio audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Clarissa was still there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was before the show went on the air. I
guess Francine had planned to meet her aunt afterwards
and go home with her. They probably left in
a hurry because Francine wasn&rsquo;t feeling well and
wanted to avoid meeting people. I heard her aunt say
something about a week end in the country. We could
find out where they went and question them, I suppose,
but I&rsquo;m sure it wouldn&rsquo;t do any good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might,&rdquo; Judy said hopefully. &ldquo;They might have
seen Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Pauline replied. &ldquo;If she deliberately
ran off with the money we lent her, she would have
made sure she wasn&rsquo;t seen. Obviously, that&rsquo;s what
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did seem obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never should have trusted her in the first
place,&rdquo; Pauline went on. &ldquo;That story she told must
have been part of her plan to trick us and make us
sorry for her. It isn&rsquo;t possible for a girl to look in a
mirror and see no reflection. Things like that only
happen in ghost stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a ghost story,&rdquo; Flo said in an awed tone,
&ldquo;only it&rsquo;s happening to us. Maybe she wasn&rsquo;t real.
She didn&rsquo;t show&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline turned to her friend. &ldquo;Flo, you aren&rsquo;t going
to believe&mdash;?&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>But Irene cut in, &ldquo;In phantoms? Of course she isn&rsquo;t.
What&rsquo;s your theory, Judy? You always come up with
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; Judy promised. &ldquo;Just give me time. It
would help if we knew exactly when she disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it just about the time that misty haze covered
the set?&rdquo; Flo questioned. &ldquo;What was it, anyway,
some new kind of vapor to make people vanish?&rdquo; she
asked nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only steam,&rdquo; Irene reassured her. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
see what was going on backstage from where I was
standing, but I had a good view of that steam kettle.
There was nothing unnatural about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Flo sounded dubious. &ldquo;Maybe not, but
there was something strange about Clarissa. Vanishing
like that&mdash;it&rsquo;s utterly fantastic!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few fantastic theories of my own,&rdquo; Judy
admitted. &ldquo;If she&rsquo;d had time to use that golden hair
wash&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think&rsquo;s in it? Vanishing cream?&rdquo;
Pauline was laughing. Her theory was really the only
sensible one, Judy decided. She was eager to talk it
over with Peter. He knew so much more about the
workings of the criminal mind than she did. There
were patterns of behavior. Would Clarissa&rsquo;s behavior
fit one of them? Somehow Judy doubted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we shouldn&rsquo;t have trusted her,&rdquo; she said
at last. &ldquo;Her innocent appearance didn&rsquo;t fool the
cashier in the restaurant. But I&rsquo;m not sorry if it fooled
us. Peter might not agree with me, but I believe in
trusting people. Clarissa may be involved in some
sort of confidence game. And yet, somehow, I believe
she is a friend. I mean a real one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a real friend to her, Judy.&rdquo; Irene shook
her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s beyond me. I suppose she&rsquo;ll go home,
wherever her home is, and we&rsquo;ll never see her again.
It was an experience, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy found she couldn&rsquo;t dismiss it that lightly.
Too many experiences had crowded in to make her
vacation in New York not at all what she had anticipated.
First there had been her discovery that Tower
House was no longer standing. It appeared to have
vanished but, in reality, it had only been torn down
to make room for a new apartment building. Irene
and Dale were now living in a more modern house
farther out on Long Island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Weird things had happened in Tower House as they
had in Judy&rsquo;s own home both before and after her
marriage to Peter Dobbs. She would never forget the
time she saw the transparent figure floating about in
her garden. Blackberry, her cat, had provided the clue
to that mystery as well as to the latest one she and
Peter had solved. Always there had been a solution.
The only real ghosts, Judy had discovered, were such
things as suspicion and fear. Some fear could be haunting
Clarissa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be somewhere,&rdquo; Judy said as they left
the theater. They took a taxi, not without misgivings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask the driver to hurry,&rdquo; Flo warned them.
&ldquo;The streets are still slippery. Remember what happened
to the woman with the red hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like mine,&rdquo; Judy recalled thoughtfully, &ldquo;only not
as natural looking. We don&rsquo;t know what happened to
her. I&rsquo;d like to meet her and ask her a few questions.
I wonder if she has regained consciousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call the hospital tomorrow and find out,&rdquo; Pauline
promised. &ldquo;Drop me off first, please,&rdquo; she told
the driver. &ldquo;Then the others want to drive on to
Penn Station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where we take the Long Island Railroad,&rdquo;
Irene explained. &ldquo;Flo goes home by train, too, but
on a different line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy found the railroad station confusing. People
were hurrying this way and that. There was an upper
level and a lower level and ever so many turns before
they reached a crowded section of the station where
Flo bade them good-by and left them to join another
line of people. It seemed to Judy that half the city
must be commuting to Long Island by train.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;I like to watch all the different faces, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she whispered to Irene. &ldquo;Clarissa could be in this
crowd&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently a man in uniform opened a gate, and the
crowd surged through. Judy and Irene found seats
on the train, but not together. A man, concealed by
his open newspaper, occupied the place next to the
window. All the seats were soon filled, and the train
started on its way. Irene, who was sitting just behind
Judy, tapped her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t talk much. The train is making too much
noise,&rdquo; she said above the creaks and rattles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m a little tired, anyway,&rdquo; Judy
confessed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you lean back and close your eyes?&rdquo;
Irene suggested. &ldquo;I will, too. It&rsquo;s an hour&rsquo;s ride&mdash;&rdquo;
A yawn came, interrupting the sentence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t sleep,&rdquo; Judy told herself when she saw
that Irene was resting. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to keep my eyes
open to watch for our station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conductor, she discovered a little later, was
calling the stations. She roused herself to listen, dozing
between stops. But it was only her conscious mind
that slept. The thoughts she could control were at
rest, but other thoughts came unbidden. <i>My hair is
dull. My hair is drab.</i> But those were Clarissa&rsquo;s
thoughts! They rushed on with the train. <i>Dull! Drab!
Dull! Drab!</i>&mdash;faster and faster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>As the unwanted thoughts pounded in Judy&rsquo;s head
the train swayed, first this way and then that way. A
frail old lady making her way down the aisle changed
suddenly to a young girl with golden hair. Judy
stared at her. Then she looked at the girl sitting beside
her and saw that she, too, had golden hair. Her
face was blank like the face of a department-store
dummy. <i>It was a man before! He had been reading
a newspaper!</i> How had the strange transformation
taken place? Had it happened this way to Clarissa?</p>
<p>Behind Judy sat another girl with a blank face and
golden hair. Another one was in front and still another
across the aisle. The train, moving backwards now,
seemed full of golden-haired girls with identical faces.
Judy&rsquo;s thoughts, too, were moving in a reverse direction.
Now she was at the station backing through the
gates. All the golden-haired people surged forward,
pressing closer and closer until she could scarcely
breathe. She tried to call to them in protest. At last,
as if from a great distance, she heard her own voice
whispering Irene&rsquo;s name. She tried desperately to speak
louder and presently the cry came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irene!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that she swayed and would have fallen sideways
if the man with the newspaper hadn&rsquo;t caught
her. Irene was at her side. Unaccountably, they were
back in the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;where&mdash;what?&rdquo; Judy stammered. She was
awake now, but the feeling that a crowd of golden-haired
people were suffocating her still lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened? Where are we?&rdquo; she managed to
ask.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br />A Night of Terror</h2>
<p>Irene&rsquo;s reply was hurried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>here</i>. Come on,
Judy! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am awake. What happened to all the golden-haired
people? They were suffocating me. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come <i>on</i>!&rdquo; Irene interrupted, pulling Judy to her
feet just as the train lurched to a stop. People began
to get off. Judy saw now that they were all kinds of
people&mdash;men, women, even a drowsy child on one
man&rsquo;s shoulder. The hair that showed below their hats
was black, brown, straight and curly. Their faces were
no longer blank. Each had its own individuality. Dark
faces, fair faces&mdash;how beautiful they suddenly were,
and how different!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed,&rdquo; Judy managed to say, &ldquo;that they
were all alike. It was a terrible, a frightening dream.
I never have nightmares, especially on trains. What
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Irene replied, laughing, &ldquo;but something
will if we don&rsquo;t hurry. The train will take us past our
station. I was asleep, too. We nearly missed it. Wait!&rdquo;
she called to the conductor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You getting off here?&rdquo; he inquired. &ldquo;Hurry up.
I&rsquo;ll hold the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It started again with a jolt almost as soon as Judy
and Irene stepped down to the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was close. People have been killed getting
off moving trains,&rdquo; Irene said with a shudder.</p>
<p>Bewildered, Judy looked around her. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t anybody
going to meet us?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale didn&rsquo;t know which train we were going to
take. We&rsquo;ll go home by taxi,&rdquo; Irene announced.</p>
<p>She hailed a cab that was just about to pull away
from the station. She and Judy were crowded in along
with other passengers who lived in the same suburban
town. Again Judy had that elated sense of being glad&mdash;glad
that they were different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible it would be if we were all alike,&rdquo;
she said to Irene as they huddled together in the
crowded taxi. &ldquo;Our faces, our hair, our thoughts&mdash;everything.
Would you like it if everyone in the whole
world had golden hair and a face like yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate it,&rdquo; Irene replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad enough when
I buy a dress and find out someone else has one like it.
Why do you ask such a question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was that way in my dream. I told you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t listening. You&rsquo;ll have to tell me again
when we&rsquo;re home. After all, it was only a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it was?&rdquo; Irene inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prophecy, maybe. People used to have prophetic
visions. Maybe, some time in the future&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab stopped to let two of the passengers out.
Irene lived in a beautiful neighborhood. The houses,
like the people who lived in them, were all different.
Behind them were tall trees, outlined against the night
sky, and a brook that reminded Judy of Dry Brook
at home. An innocent brook and yet, when it had
poured its flood waters into the pond above the Roulsville
dam ... Judy shuddered at the memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace dreamed the dam would break&mdash;and it
did!&rdquo; she said suddenly. &ldquo;I can still hear the roar and
feel the horror&mdash;before I knew the people would be
saved. Irene, there could be another flood&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What flood?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A flood of advertising. Don&rsquo;t laugh. Flo asked me
to talk you into accepting that offer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need,&rdquo; Irene broke in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already
decided. Flo&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s silly of me to feel the way
I do about commercials. If I can get a sponsor there&rsquo;s
no reason why I shouldn&rsquo;t be on the big network.
Dale thinks I should. There he is at the window
motioning for us to hurry,&rdquo; Irene observed as the
cab stopped to let them out. &ldquo;Oh, I do hope little
Judy is all right. There&rsquo;s a light in her room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were lights all over the house. Dale&rsquo;s anxious
face told Judy that something was wrong. He started
to say something to her, but Irene broke in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s little Judy. I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, she hurried into the baby&rsquo;s room with
Judy close behind her. Little Judy was awake. Apparently
she had reached over and turned on the light
by herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Daddy on the tefelone,&rdquo; she announced
solemnly. Then, with a little jump, she landed in
Irene&rsquo;s arms and began to hug her. Judy could see
that she was perfectly all right. But something was
wrong. She could feel it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You comed out of the TV. I saw you, Mommy,&rdquo;
the baby continued her chatter. &ldquo;I saw the bad witch,
too. She <i>skeered</i> me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she, lamb? I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Mommy. I like to be skeered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you thinking about the witch? Is that why
you couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did sleep. Daddy woke me up. He was talking
on the tefelone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you love the way she says <i>telephone</i>?&rdquo; Irene
exclaimed, hugging little Judy again. &ldquo;I was so sure
something had happened to her, but if it was just the
telephone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Peter called up. We didn&rsquo;t give Dale a
chance to tell us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dale, in the doorway, interrupted Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the hospital. I tried to call you, but you
had already left the theater. We can be thankful it
isn&rsquo;t any worse&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Why did the hospital
call? What hospital was it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Dale mentioned the name of the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy, isn&rsquo;t that where you said they took that red-headed
woman?&rdquo; Irene questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but they wouldn&rsquo;t call Dale about her. She&rsquo;s
a stranger. If someone we know was hurt. If Peter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> Peter. I tried to break the news gently,&rdquo;
Dale said in so grave a tone that Judy found herself
staring at him in silent terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale, what has happened?&rdquo; she cried when she
could find her voice. &ldquo;Why is he in the hospital? What
are they going to do to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to operate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why? Why? Peter is never sick. He must be
hurt. Was he&mdash;was he&mdash;&rdquo; The word wouldn&rsquo;t come.
Judy knew Peter&rsquo;s work was dangerous. She knew,
too, that his latest assignment was one of his biggest.
He couldn&rsquo;t discuss it, but he had said, just before he
left, &ldquo;Wish me luck, Angel. This is something really
big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To an FBI man, something big was usually a raid.
Peter carried a gun but seldom used it. &ldquo;Criminals
carry guns, too,&rdquo; thought Judy. Aloud she said, &ldquo;Tell
me the truth, Dale. Was Peter&mdash;shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dale nodded, adding quickly, &ldquo;It could have been
worse. They&rsquo;re going to operate to remove a bullet
from his shoulder. There&rsquo;s not much danger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is a little. He came close to being killed,
didn&rsquo;t he? How soon can I see him?&rdquo; Judy questioned
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital will call&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When? When?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the operation is over. Meantime, why don&rsquo;t
you try and get a little rest? You can stretch out here
on the sofa, Judy, until the telephone rings,&rdquo; Dale
suggested.</p>
<p>Judy shook her head. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I&rsquo;m going
back to New York&mdash;I want to be at the hospital&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the middle of the night?&rdquo; Irene shook her head.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do Peter more good if you&rsquo;re not exhausted
when you see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This silenced Judy. She knew it would be better
to try and get some rest as Dale suggested. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t
sleep,&rdquo; she told herself when Dale and Irene had left
her alone in the dimly lighted living room. She remembered
thinking the same thing just before she
fell asleep on the train. The sofa was long and low&mdash;like
a train. Again she could hear the clanking wheels
as they rumbled out the words, &ldquo;Dull, drab, dull,
drab ...&rdquo; faster and faster. Once more she was
crowded in, almost suffocated by the throng of golden-haired
people. She was looking for Peter. But she
could see nothing but blank faces topped by golden
curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter, where are you?&rdquo; came the voiceless cry.</p>
<p>Judy awoke from her dream of terror to hear
the telephone ringing. She sprang toward it, half
asleep, jerked the instrument from its resting place,
and asked breathlessly, &ldquo;Is this the hospital? How is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Honey.&rdquo; The voice of Peter&rsquo;s sister seemed to
come from very far away. &ldquo;They called us, since they
couldn&rsquo;t reach you. How is he, Judy? And how are
you taking it? I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I just had to call and
find out how everything is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<div class="img">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Is this the hospital?&rdquo; she asked breathlessly</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s terrible,&rdquo; wailed Judy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how Peter is. I couldn&rsquo;t find him in the parade of
golden-haired, faceless people. Honey, promise me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise anything,&rdquo; came the sympathetic voice
over the wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then promise&mdash;&rdquo; Judy paused, trying to shake
off the web of sleep that seemed to be holding her
prisoner. Then, to her own surprise and Honey&rsquo;s
horror, she finished, &ldquo;Promise me you won&rsquo;t do anything
to change the color of your hair!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />Before Daylight</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Judy, are you well?&rdquo; Honey&rsquo;s voice held a note
of deep anxiety. She was calling all the way from
Farringdon, Judy knew. Judy hadn&rsquo;t meant to worry
her. But how could she explain what she had just said
when she didn&rsquo;t understand it herself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;&rdquo; Now Honey was floundering for the
right words. &ldquo;Was it too much of a shock&mdash;about
Peter? Or were you just trying to change the subject?
This is certainly a strange time to be asking me
about my hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. I was half asleep. Forgive me,&rdquo; Judy said.
&ldquo;I was dreaming, I guess. This is the second time I&rsquo;ve
had the same dream. It still seems horribly real. I am
worried, of course. I&rsquo;m still waiting for the hospital
to call.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll hang up so they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute. Talk a little more,&rdquo; Judy begged
finally. &ldquo;I need the reassurance of your voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more like the Judy I know. Don&rsquo;t worry.
Peter will be all right, and then you&rsquo;ll stop dreaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I had the dream before I knew he was hurt,&rdquo;
Judy protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to explain it. I&rsquo;m no good at that
sort of thing. Remember that old dream book, Judy?
I&rsquo;ll hunt it up, if you want me to, and find out what
it means to dream of faceless people&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With golden hair.&rdquo; Judy stopped herself quickly
and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother, Honey. The dream doesn&rsquo;t
matter any more. It&rsquo;s Peter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, dear. Call me back when you have news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy promised that she would. She felt better after
talking with Honey. Now she was wide awake. Irene,
hearing her up, tiptoed out into the living room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; replied Judy. &ldquo;That was Honey on the
phone. It seems ages ago that we were pretending she
was at the table with us. So much has happened since
then&mdash;Clarissa&rsquo;s disappearance, and now Peter. I want
to go to him, Irene. I&rsquo;m not tired any more. I can sit
in the hospital waiting room and be there when he
wakes up. The Long Island trains run all night, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Irene consulted a timetable that was tacked to a bulletin
board beside the telephone. &ldquo;We just missed the
two fifty-eight. This is Sunday morning. The trains
don&rsquo;t run very often. There isn&rsquo;t another one until five
o&rsquo;clock. But we can drive in if you want to. We can
bundle little Judy into the back seat, and she&rsquo;ll never
know the difference. Want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do want to,&rdquo; Judy replied gratefully. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t stand this waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor dear!&rdquo; Irene sympathized. &ldquo;We hoped
you would get a little more sleep. Dale!&rdquo; she called to
her husband. &ldquo;Judy wants us to drive in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather thought she would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He appeared all dressed and ready. Irene had not
undressed. Little Judy was carried to the car, blankets
and all. She stirred once, said, &ldquo;Go way, witch!&rdquo; in a
sleepy voice and then cuddled down to sleep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That witch did scare her,&rdquo; Irene began in a worried
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she did. She was meant to,&rdquo; Dale broke
in with a reassuring grin. &ldquo;I wish you could have seen
little Judy&rsquo;s eyes when you came in with your magic
wand to chase the witch away. It was symbolic of
hope chasing away fear, and beautifully done, my
dear. I was very proud of you. Sleeping Beauty herself
was something of a disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mean she wasn&rsquo;t beautiful and all that.
Francine Dow is a girl of many faces. She did manage
to look young and frightened if that was the effect she
was trying to achieve. You could hardly see her face
for that golden wig.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a wig?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I thought it was the
natural color of her hair. I&rsquo;m afraid I still don&rsquo;t know
whether it&rsquo;s black, brown or golden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irene laughed. &ldquo;Very few actresses can keep the
natural color of their hair. They&rsquo;re the real changelings.
They change their hair and even their faces to
suit the various parts they have to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be all right for actresses, but for the rest
of us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it,&rdquo; Irene advised. &ldquo;I know
that dream upset you, but can&rsquo;t you see that it wasn&rsquo;t
real? It couldn&rsquo;t happen that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If everybody listened to the advertising on TV
there&rsquo;d be a lot more golden-haired people than there
are now. There&rsquo;d be too many. You&rsquo;d see yourself
coming and going just like the parade of golden-haired
people in my dream. Everybody whose hair
wasn&rsquo;t golden would be thinking, &lsquo;Your hair is dull.
Your hair is drab!&rsquo;&mdash;just the way I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Dale, looking past Irene&rsquo;s golden
head to Judy&rsquo;s mop of curly red hair. &ldquo;How anyone
could say a thing like that about either of you is more
than I can understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it either,&rdquo; Judy admitted, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s true. I kept hearing <i>dull</i>, <i>drab</i>, until even the train
wheels seemed to be repeating it. If I didn&rsquo;t have red
hair and if I hadn&rsquo;t been teased all my life about how
bright it is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what would you do?&rdquo; asked Irene when
Judy hesitated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wash my hair with that golden hair wash. I did
buy some for you,&rdquo; Judy confessed when Irene made
no comment. Dale was busy with his driving, and
Judy sat between them in the front seat of the car.
There was hardly any traffic this early in the morning,
but there was a heavy fog that made it hard for Dale
to see more than a few feet ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For me?&rdquo; Irene asked incredulously. &ldquo;Why on
earth would you buy that stuff for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Judy confessed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the
way I&rsquo;ve been thinking things without knowing why
I thought them. Peter never lets anything turn him
from his convictions. I had a feeling, on the train,
that something was wrong, while I was dreaming. I
couldn&rsquo;t know about Peter. But I did know something
was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy had been trying to hide her worry, but it was
no use. They talked of many things as the car sped on
toward the hospital. But their thoughts were with
Peter. New York&rsquo;s skyline could be seen but faintly as
they crossed Manhattan Bridge. The fog had lifted a
little, but it was not yet daylight when Dale stopped
before a large building. It loomed, gray and forbidding,
against the cold night sky.</p>
<p>Inside, the scrubbed stone floors and bare walls gave
Judy the impression that they had entered a fortress
instead of a hospital. A uniformed guard at the door
directed them to a desk where Judy learned that
Peter had been taken to a private room in the new
wing. The operation was over, but he was still under
sedation, the nurse said. She added brightly, &ldquo;You can
see him in about an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>It would have been a long hour if another nurse, on
night duty, hadn&rsquo;t suddenly recognized Irene. Irene
had come in with Judy, leaving Dale to mind little
Judy, who was asleep in the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the Golden Girl, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the nurse
asked, stopping Irene as they entered the luxurious
waiting room in the new wing. &ldquo;One of our patients
has been asking for you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa!&rdquo; Judy and Irene exclaimed in the same
breath.</p>
<p>The nurse looked a little puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to wait here anyway. Could we see her?&rdquo;
asked Irene. &ldquo;We were awfully worried. Was she
badly hurt? We looked all over the theater. How and
where did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a street accident,&rdquo; replied the nurse in a
brisk, professional manner. &ldquo;She was in a cab. Her
doctor can give you the details. I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t
visit her at this hour. It would disturb the other patients.
Except in extreme emergencies, visitors are
never allowed before daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<br />Serious Trouble</h2>
<p>Judy wanted to tell the nurse that this was an extreme
emergency. But was it? A girl had vanished.
Still the fact remained that she might have slipped out
of the theater on purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter will help us figure out what really happened,&rdquo;
declared Judy. &ldquo;Oh, I hope he&rsquo;s well enough
to be&mdash;interested. Right now I&rsquo;m more concerned with
what happened to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he be allowed to tell you?&rdquo; Irene asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. So much of his work is secret. That&rsquo;s
the hardest part,&rdquo; Judy continued, a little break in her
voice. &ldquo;I never know what dangers he&rsquo;s facing. Usually
he tries to make a joke of it when I ask him. But
this time I can&rsquo;t help thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Irene&rsquo;s hand closed gently over Judy&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think
of what might have been. Just be glad he&rsquo;s here with
good nurses to take care of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad. I&rsquo;m glad Clarissa&rsquo;s here, too&mdash;if that
patient is Clarissa. I&rsquo;d like to think she didn&rsquo;t trick us,
but how could the accident have happened?&rdquo; Judy
wondered. &ldquo;And where was she going in a cab?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It almost makes a person believe in phantoms,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Irene asked. &ldquo;Clarissa was so&mdash;na&iuml;ve is the
word. And now if she&rsquo;s hurt&mdash;Oh, Judy! Why are we
always getting mixed up in other people&rsquo;s troubles?
We have enough of our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way I look at it, other people&rsquo;s troubles are
our troubles. Peter feels that way, too,&rdquo; Judy continued
thoughtfully. &ldquo;He says what hurts one of us
hurts all the rest. We can&rsquo;t isolate ourselves and pretend
trouble doesn&rsquo;t exist. We have to fight the good
fight with fidelity, bravery, and integrity. That&rsquo;s the
motto of the FBI, and if anybody has those three
qualities, it&rsquo;s Peter. He&rsquo;s faithful, brave, and I never
knew anybody as honest and sincere and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy was in tears, suddenly. The strain of waiting
had been too much. A nurse, hurrying in, reassured
her that Peter&rsquo;s condition was not serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is asking for you,&rdquo; she added in the usual composed
manner of hospital nurses. &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would she come? Judy wondered how she kept
her feet from flying down the corridor. At the door of
Peter&rsquo;s room she paused, a nameless fear coming over
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go in first,&rdquo; she begged of the nurse, who had
preceded her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure I look all right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;You look fine,&rdquo; the nurse interrupted with a smile.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s seen enough of me. It&rsquo;s you he wants. Go in to
him just as you are, Mrs. Dobbs. I think it would be
better if you went in alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irene was quick to understand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out and tell
Dale&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him not to wait,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be here all
day. I&rsquo;ll come out to Long Island this evening&mdash;by
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slight hesitation in Judy&rsquo;s voice did not betray
her. She dreaded that train ride. But she felt she had to
take herself in hand. Peter was depending on her.</p>
<p>A hospital attendant spoke to Judy as she entered
the large, cheerful room where Peter was lying flat
in bed with a bottle of transparent liquid suspended
above his bed. &ldquo;Watch the intravenous. He mustn&rsquo;t
move his arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Judy replied. &ldquo;My father is a doctor.
I&rsquo;ll see that nothing goes wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice was determinedly cheerful. The young
attendant left, closing the door softly. Judy was alone
with Peter. For a moment she was all choked up with
emotion and didn&rsquo;t know what to say. He smiled a
little, wryly, and glanced toward the bottle that was
feeding liquid nourishment into his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Careful there,&rdquo; he warned as she bent over to kiss
him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my breakfast there in the bottle. A
funny way to eat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be careful,&rdquo; she promised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit on the other
side of the bed. Which shoulder was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The left.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll sit on the right. You want me to stay
here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want you.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s strong fingers closed
over her outstretched hand. &ldquo;Judy, it was my big
chance, and I muffed it. I let him get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to talk about it&mdash;unless you want to,&rdquo;
Judy told him gently. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re still very weak. You
must save your strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He was quiet for a moment just
looking at Judy as if he could never see enough of
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always&mdash;so brave,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>Judy didn&rsquo;t feel very brave. She felt like bursting
into tears again. Little by little she heard how Peter
had been brought to the hospital unconscious from
loss of blood. They had given him a transfusion before
the operation. That was why it had taken so long.
Removing the bullet, he said, was a simple matter. It
had been imbedded in the flesh close to his shoulder
blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be as good as new in a day or so,&rdquo; he assured
Judy, who sat beside his bed, ready to listen whenever
he felt like talking. &ldquo;My partner cornered most of the
gang. They were better organized than we thought.
We trailed this man&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What man?&rdquo; Judy asked when Peter paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;His name&rsquo;s Clarence Lawson. I can tell you about
it now. It&rsquo;s public knowledge. The public has to be
warned against such characters,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;It all
started when a woman came into our New York office
and said her church had never received a donation she
had given a man who claimed to be on the Ways and
Means Committee. He&rsquo;d enlisted her sympathy and
talked her into donating quite a substantial sum to
what she thought was the building fund. Lawson had
joined the church and gained the confidence of a number
of influential people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you call the confidence game, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Did you catch up with this&mdash;this
Lawson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, almost. We trailed him and overheard some
of his plans. Then we made some quick plans of our
own. Did you ever hear the story of the three little
pigs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Judy replied, puzzled. &ldquo;Are you joking?
What do the three little pigs have to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third pig, if you will remember, got to the
orchard ahead of the wolf. Well,&rdquo; Peter continued,
&ldquo;that was what we planned to do. We were there, but
the wolf was early, too. So he huffed and he puffed
and he blew the house in, and he shot up the poor little
pigs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was this house?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Or aren&rsquo;t
you allowed to tell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you where it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Peter sighed
tiredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; Judy told him gently. &ldquo;Stay quiet for a
while, and I&rsquo;ll tell you a story. We met a girl, and
Pauline thinks she was playing the confidence game,
too. Anyway, she made us sorry for her, and we each
gave her five dollars so she could take the train home
to West Virginia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did she take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train? I don&rsquo;t know. She took the money, if
that&rsquo;s what you mean. She also accepted our invitation
to Irene&rsquo;s show. I wish you could have seen it, Peter.
Irene was marvelous as the good fairy, and her guest
star, Francine Dow, made a beautiful Sleeping Beauty.
The witch was a little frightening, though. She
swooped in and seemed to cast an evil spell over the
audience. Then Clarissa&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the girl I was telling you about,&rdquo; Judy said.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s here in the hospital, I think. Peter, would you
like to rest while I find out if the patient they brought
here really is Clarissa? If I speak to the nurse who
recognized Irene, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll let me see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Irene here?&rdquo; Peter questioned, pain as well as
puzzlement in his blue eyes as they searched Judy&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was. Oh, Peter! I hope I&rsquo;m not tiring you,
talking so much!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;One of the nurses
stopped Irene on the way in and said a patient had
been asking for her. We thought of Clarissa right
away. You see, if she met with an accident, it would
explain her disappearance. I did tell you she vanished,
didn&rsquo;t I? We never saw her leave the theater, but I
suppose she could have slipped out during the show
and afterwards changed her mind and tried to come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>&ldquo;She could have slipped out with no intention of
coming back. I doubt if you&rsquo;ll find her here in the
hospital,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;but it will do no harm to try.
I can see you&rsquo;re deep in another mystery. I wish I
could help you solve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can, Peter. You&rsquo;ll be well soon,&rdquo; Judy told
him hopefully. &ldquo;Then we can help each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t try to help me this time,
Angel.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice was grave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in trouble&mdash;serious
trouble, and I&rsquo;d rather you kept out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />The Wrong Girl</h2>
<p>Just outside the door to Peter&rsquo;s room, Judy paused,
trying to think. Serious trouble! What did Peter
mean? Had the man, Lawson, the wolf in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing, discovered his whereabouts? Would he be
waiting for him when he was released from the hospital?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please! Keep him safe,&rdquo; Judy said to the walls
which seemed, suddenly, to move dizzily before her
eyes. The activities of the hospital day were beginning.
Night nurses were going off duty. Day nurses were
busy with breakfast trays. Carts were being wheeled&mdash;up
and down. Up and down. In a moment Judy
feared she would find they were being wheeled by
golden-haired nurses with identical faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel faint?&rdquo; a voice asked quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Judy turned to see one of the nurses standing beside
her. The dizzy feeling had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, nurse. I&rsquo;m all right&mdash;now. I was looking
for the night nurse, but I guess I&rsquo;m too late.
Could you direct me to the patient who was asking
for the Golden Girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient is awake,&rdquo; was the quiet answer. &ldquo;But
you must have a permission slip to see her. Tell the
guard you think you can identify the patient in Room
334, and you will be allowed to go up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy, catching her breath in an
exclamation of surprise. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she identified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; the nurse replied. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in a semi-coma.
Sometimes we can make a little sense out of what she
says, and sometimes we can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s Clarissa, I don&rsquo;t wonder. Didn&rsquo;t she give
her name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not her own name. All she would tell us was
that she had to see Irene Meredith. Mrs. Meredith
didn&rsquo;t leave, did she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid she did. But I know her. I can identify
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the nurse. &ldquo;The guard will
probably let you go right up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Judy was standing beside a bed
with crib sides around it. The next thing she saw was
a white face&mdash;white and wholly unfamiliar. Flaming
red hair fanned out on the pillow. The woman looked
at least thirty. Judy gazed at her a moment. Then she
turned to the nurse who had escorted her to the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My friend, Clarissa Valentine,
disappeared. I thought this patient might be
Clarissa, but she isn&rsquo;t. I never saw her before in my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me anything at all about her?&rdquo; the
nurse asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except what you probably know already.
We talked with the taxi driver after the ambulance
drove away from the scene of the accident. He told
us what little we know about it. Apparently this
woman was on her way to the theater to see Irene&rsquo;s&mdash;I
mean the Golden Girl show. I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Judy
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; mumbled the patient. &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
sorry.&rdquo; Then, suddenly grasping the crib sides, she
cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get out of here. Please, let me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; the nurse prompted Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then we heard the ambulance siren. The
show was nearly over so we waited until afterwards
to find out what it was. That&rsquo;s all I know. I&rsquo;m afraid
it won&rsquo;t be of much help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid not,&rdquo; the nurse replied sadly as
Judy turned to go.</p>
<p>Peter was sleeping when she returned to his room.
He looked so peaceful she decided not to awaken him.
She&rsquo;d help, though. Later on they&rsquo;d talk it all over.
There was sure to be some way she could help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go out and have breakfast,&rdquo; Judy told the new
nurse who had just come on duty. The day nurse
assured her that there was no need for her to come
back until visiting hours that afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll notice a big change in your husband by
then. He will probably sleep most of the morning.&rdquo;
Judy tried to hide a yawn and the nurse added,
&ldquo;You could use a little sleep yourself, Mrs. Dobbs.
You must have been awake most of the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy didn&rsquo;t say so, but she had rested more when
she was awake than when she had been dreaming.
What had caused those terrible nightmares? Judy
dreaded sleep because of them. She ordered two cups
of coffee in a nearby restaurant, hoping to keep herself
awake. Then she telephoned Pauline Faulkner and
told her about Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor girl! Why don&rsquo;t you come up and rest
at my house until visiting hours?&rdquo; Pauline suggested.
&ldquo;I expect Flo. It&rsquo;s Sunday, or had you forgotten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do need some sleep,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;But I keep
dreaming the same dream every time I close my eyes.
I&rsquo;d never dare&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; Pauline interrupted. &ldquo;So do I. And
just now when I spoke to Flo she said she&rsquo;d had a
rough night, too. She didn&rsquo;t say why but, to use an
old expression of yours, I&rsquo;d like to bet something
precious that it was because she had nightmares, too.
Come up and we&rsquo;ll compare notes. I feel&mdash;&rdquo; Pauline
lowered her voice almost to a whisper. Judy could
hardly hear the word &ldquo;bewitched,&rdquo; but she knew the
feeling.</p>
<p>When Judy arrived at the tall stone house which
was Dr. Faulkner&rsquo;s combined home and office, she
said, &ldquo;Pauline, as you said, it&rsquo;s Sunday. Let&rsquo;s go to
church.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Pauline hesitated a moment. Then she
said, &ldquo;You may not like my church, Judy. It isn&rsquo;t at
all like the one you attend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which one?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;The little white church
in Dry Brook Hollow isn&rsquo;t like the one I used to attend
in Farringdon, but I like them both. I think it
does a person good to learn different ways of believing,
don&rsquo;t you? How is your church different, Pauline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline shrugged. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just a little
more formal. But if you watch other people and do
what they do you&rsquo;ll get along all right. The order of
service is printed on the church calendar. They&rsquo;ll give
you one as you come in. It&rsquo;s a little church crowded in
between two tall buildings. They&rsquo;re going to tear it
down and build a new one farther uptown. I&rsquo;m rather
sorry. But I guess it&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In other words, you bow to the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline laughed. &ldquo;You sound like your brother
Horace. Does he know about Peter, Judy? It isn&rsquo;t
going to be in the newspapers, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so. Not yet, anyway. I telephoned
home right after breakfast. Horace will put something
in after he checks with the authorities. Publicity could
be dangerous. That&rsquo;s what I told him. There&rsquo;s nothing
about Peter in the New York papers. I did find this,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy pointed to a review of <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>. A
columnist, known for his sarcasm, had called the play
a triumph of youth over experience.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for the star, if that was Francine Dow, she
has certainly discovered the fountain of youth. She has
lost her voice and gained the fragile beauty of a china
doll. This reviewer couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are others like it,&rdquo; Pauline spoke up as Judy
paused in her reading. &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll show you. This
paper calls her a changeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; Judy stared at the paper. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
Clarissa called herself. I don&rsquo;t get it at all. She was
right beside us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>know</i>. I certainly thought she was. Here&rsquo;s
Flo. Maybe she can explain it,&rdquo; Judy finished as the
doorbell rang.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />The Name on the Calendar</h2>
<p>Flo was flushed and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the papers?&rdquo; was her first question.
&ldquo;The reviewers don&rsquo;t think that was Francine Dow on
Irene&rsquo;s show. They say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw it,&rdquo; Pauline interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those were the very words Clarissa used. Is
there any word from her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet. Perhaps there never will be. Peter says
she could have slipped out of the theater with no intention
of coming back. He&rsquo;s in the hospital, Flo.
I&rsquo;m so upset!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to him?&rdquo; Flo was immediately all
sympathetic concern.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>Judy started to tell her and then thought better of
it. Florence Garner was a stranger, too. Judy had
met her only a few hours before she met Clarissa. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t trust strangers,&rdquo; she told herself grimly.
Aloud she said briefly, &ldquo;He was hurt. He&rsquo;s in the same
hospital where they took that redheaded woman. She
was asking for Irene. I don&rsquo;t know why. We both
thought she might be Clarissa&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she wasn&rsquo;t? Then who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Judy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so confusing,
I need a little peace and quiet to make any
sense to what&rsquo;s happening. We thought we&rsquo;d go to
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flo looked from one of them to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not telling me everything,&rdquo; she charged.
&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happened. Something terrible has happened,
and you&rsquo;re keeping it from me. Do you think
dreams warn people of tragedy? I dreamed&mdash;It&rsquo;s still
so real I can hardly tell you about it. But I dreamed
that my hair&mdash;&rdquo; She touched her head and seemed relieved
upon discovering she was wearing her hat.
&ldquo;Well, never mind about that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa hypnotized us. We&rsquo;re all under her spell.
Maybe church&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy stopped Pauline before she could finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Religion isn&rsquo;t magic,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;something
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s sudden sincerity seemed to confuse Flo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I thought you were keeping something
from me, but if you want me to go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we want you.&rdquo; Pauline decided the
question for her. &ldquo;Shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>Judy found Pauline&rsquo;s church even more formal than
she had described it. The minister and the people in
the choir wore black robes. Judy&rsquo;s prayers were all
for Peter and his work that had been so cruelly interrupted.
Thoughts of what he must have suffered
took possession of her mind and would not leave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is, my friends,&rdquo; the minister was saying,
&ldquo;we love each other and think that is enough. But
were we not commanded in the fifth book of Moses,
&lsquo;Love ye therefore the stranger; for ye were strangers
in the land of Egypt.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Judy was more confused than ever. Clarissa
was a stranger. Judy had followed her heart and loved
her as a friend. But had she done the right thing? Was
she a friend or a phantom? Should she have trusted
her? What of the confidence game?</p>
<p>The words of the church service were printed on
the calendar Judy had received at the door when the
usher had handed her the hymnal. On the back, as she
turned the calendar over in her hand during the long
sermon, she noticed a list of names. Trustees of the
church and the chairmen of various committees were
listed. The names meant nothing to her until, all at
once, she saw the name, <i>Clarence Lawson</i>! He was
listed as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
It seemed impossible. Could he, a man wanted by the
FBI, be sitting quietly in the congregation? Peter had
trailed him and lost him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter said it was public knowledge,&rdquo; Judy thought.
&ldquo;But surely these people don&rsquo;t know the name of a
confidence man is printed on their church calendar!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Pauline, sitting on her right, touched Judy&rsquo;s elbow.
She was the last one to stand up when the congregation
rose to sing the closing hymn. Flo gave her a
look that asked, wordlessly, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
Pauline whispered something to Flo as they filed out
of church, and Judy knew Pauline had told Flo that
Peter had been shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the name of the man he was trailing.&rdquo; Judy
pointed to the name on the back of the calendar. &ldquo;Do
you know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Pauline replied, puzzled. &ldquo;Everybody
in the church knows him. He&rsquo;s conducting our building
fund drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he here?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>Pauline looked around. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see him. That&rsquo;s
funny. He never misses a Sunday. His wife isn&rsquo;t here
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she an actress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens, no! She&rsquo;s a typical clubwoman, if you
know what I mean. They haven&rsquo;t been here long, but
already she&rsquo;s at the head of everything. I don&rsquo;t know
where she is this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;have red hair, does she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking, Judy? Her hair is gray. If
you&rsquo;re trying to identify that patient in the hospital
you ought to ask Irene about her. They must know
each other if she was asking for her. Maybe she&rsquo;s an
actress. Irene knows a lot of theatrical people. Authors
are my specialty,&rdquo; Pauline finished with a laugh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ad men are mine. They would change the minister&rsquo;s
text around to make it read, &lsquo;<i>Sell</i> ye therefore the
stranger,&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s world,&rdquo; Flo said with a
sigh. &ldquo;Nobody cares much about the kind of love they
tell you about in church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care about it,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p>Flo gave her an odd look. &ldquo;You sound like
Clarissa. She said she cared about the truth, but what
happens? She disappears&mdash;with our money. I guess
you just don&rsquo;t know what anybody is these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pauline agreed. &ldquo;The people in our church certainly
don&rsquo;t know who Clarence Lawson is. Why was Peter
trailing him, Judy? Is he wanted by the FBI?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. It&rsquo;s about some money for a church
building fund. He was supposed to turn it over to the
treasurer of the church, but he didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he? Oh dear!&rdquo; Pauline exclaimed. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t give much, because we weren&rsquo;t very enthusiastic
about the new building, but a lot of people did. It&rsquo;s
supposed to be a real community center when it&rsquo;s finished.
Mr. Lawson knew an architect who drew up
the plans and made an estimate. There was talk of
bringing in professional fund raisers before Mr. Lawson
took over. He said there was no need to pay people
to raise money among us if we&rsquo;d give it freely
without pledges. Then he passed a plate around, and
people threw in big bills and checks made out to him
as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. He
talked people into giving just the way Clarissa did. He
was like her in a way. Even his name is a little like
hers&mdash;Clarence, Clarissa&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably just a coincidence.&rdquo; In spite of the
evidence against her, Judy found herself defending
Clarissa. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way I feel about her. I have no other
reason,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;You girls are probably right.&rdquo;</p>

<br />A Wanted Thief</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Judy!&rdquo; The exclamation came from Pauline, very
suddenly as if she had just thought of something. &ldquo;I
know what we ought to do. We ought to visit Mr.
Lawson. If he really is the thief I&rsquo;d like to know about
it. I could pretend I wanted to make a donation or
something. Shall we try it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy hesitated. She didn&rsquo;t like that sort of pretending,
though sometimes it was the best strategy. Also,
Peter had asked her to stay out of trouble, and this
would be walking right into it. But it could very
easily be her chance to help him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do we get there?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is it very far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry. Let&rsquo;s eat something first,&rdquo; Flo suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>The three girls had lunch in the same restaurant
where they first met Clarissa. They asked the cashier
about her, but he claimed he remembered no such
scene as they described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one goes away from this restaurant angry,&rdquo;
he told them. &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; He pointed to a
decorated sign bearing the words: <span class="sc">Our Aim is to
Please the Best People in the World, Our Customers</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this girl tried to cheat you,&rdquo; Pauline protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a customer. She was still one of the best
people,&rdquo; he replied without a change of expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well talk to a statue,&rdquo; Flo whispered.
&ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a few blocks to the house where Mr.
Lawson lives,&rdquo; Pauline told them. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t as cold
and blustery today as it was yesterday. We can walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the way, Judy and Flo began comparing their
dreams of the night before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it sounds ridiculous,&rdquo; Judy said, &ldquo;but I
can&rsquo;t help feeling that my dream was a warning of
some kind and that we ought to heed it. I&rsquo;m not just
sure how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about you, Pauline? Did you dream about
hair, too? That may be a clue to what&rsquo;s happening to
us, if you did,&rdquo; Flo said eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The dark-haired girl shook her head. &ldquo;My dreams
are never very clear. I can&rsquo;t remember them well
enough to tell them afterwards. I only know I cried
out in my sleep, and Mary came up to see what was
the matter. She said I was calling for my mother. I
never do that. I hardly remember her. Mary&rsquo;s kept
house for us ever since I was about little Judy&rsquo;s age.
But Mother did have golden hair. I take after Father.
I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it,&rdquo; Judy stopped her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to
wish you had golden hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we have been hypnotized?&rdquo; Flo began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Ask your father about hypnotism,
Pauline,&rdquo; Judy urged. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know. He may use it on
his patients. Dr. Zoller, a sort of uncle of mine, is a
hypnotist, and Dad approves of it when it&rsquo;s not misused.
Of course, if hypnotism was part of a confidence
game Clarissa was playing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was! I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Flo interrupted. &ldquo;She said
we read her mind, and she talked us into buying that
shampoo, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure. I thought it was your idea,&rdquo; Judy
began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sure. She talked us into lending her the
money, too. Then she left the theater when we were
all so interested in the play we didn&rsquo;t notice. It was all
a trick,&rdquo; declared Flo. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see it? Clarissa did
it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She even vanished on purpose,&rdquo; Pauline agreed.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear to me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear to me, too,&rdquo; Judy interrupted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfectly
clear that we haven&rsquo;t found out a single thing.
Isn&rsquo;t it about time we started using our heads? Peter
doesn&rsquo;t jump to conclusions without examining the
evidence. If he&rsquo;s willing to risk his life to turn up a
few facts to present at preliminary hearings, the least
we can do is discuss this with him before we decide
who&rsquo;s guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty of what?&rdquo; asked Flo. &ldquo;Making us dream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly all three girls began to laugh. It seemed
ridiculous for them to be taking their dreams so seriously.
But their laughter died in their throats when
they reached Mr. Lawson&rsquo;s house. Judy was the first
to notice the shattered glass in the door. It was broken
in a peculiar way. Several round holes with cracks
radiating from them told the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullet holes!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;This was the place
where it happened. You&rsquo;re too late, Pauline. You
won&rsquo;t find Mr. Lawson&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime Flo had rung the bell. A heavy-set
woman came in answer to it just in time to hear the
name. She peered at the girls through the shattered
glass before she opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it&rsquo;s Mr. Lawson you want, is it?&rdquo; she inquired.
&ldquo;And what would you be wanting with the good
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good man! Judy could hardly contain herself. Did
the woman know what sort of man he really was?
Or had he fooled her just as he had fooled the people
in Pauline&rsquo;s church? He had even outwitted Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did want to see him,&rdquo; Pauline began, affecting
a timid voice. &ldquo;We came to make a donation&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; the woman interrupted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it, if
you please, and forward it to him. He&rsquo;s away for a
couple of weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>&ldquo;Far away,&rdquo; thought Judy, &ldquo;and not likely to
come back.&rdquo; Aloud she said, with perfect control,
&ldquo;We prefer to send the money ourselves. Could you
give us his address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, I could.&rdquo; She hesitated a moment and
then went inside, returning with a piece of paper on
which a post office box number was written. &ldquo;You
can reach him there,&rdquo; she said briefly and closed the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do we do?&rdquo; asked Flo. &ldquo;Shall we write
him a letter and invite him to come back home and be
arrested? We aren&rsquo;t really going to send him any
money, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t need our money. He has plenty,&rdquo;
Judy began when Pauline interrupted heatedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly has. People were generous. There
was all of fifty thousand dollars in the building fund.
With that much on hand he can stay in hiding for a
long, long time. Are you going to tell Peter where we
were?&rdquo; Pauline asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;It bothers me when I
have to keep things from him. He won&rsquo;t like it, of
course. Maybe I ought to wait until he&rsquo;s feeling a
little better before I say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Pauline agreed. &ldquo;Just stay
cheerful for Peter, and don&rsquo;t worry about a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />Thieves of the Mind</h2>
<p>Judy found Pauline&rsquo;s advice hard to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about a thing,&rdquo; she had said when
they parted on Sunday. But the words had meant very
little. In church, in the restaurant, in front of the
bullet-riddled door, on the subway returning to the
hospital, and especially on the train going back to
Long Island&mdash;wherever Judy went a vague worry
went with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me?&rdquo; she wondered.
&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I clear my head and think straight the
way I used to?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Judy spent a restless night, haunted by the faceless
golden-haired people of her dream. Again she was
looking for Clarissa. But now she had a clue. They
had all dreamed about hair&mdash;Pauline, Flo, and herself.
But why? If they had been hypnotized as part of a
confidence game, Peter ought to know about it. The
next day Judy told him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d almost think someone had taken possession
of our minds. All three of us had nightmares. What
do you suppose caused them?&rdquo; she asked when she
was visiting him in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Peter shook his head. He was sitting up with his
shoulder in a cast and feeling very much better. She
hadn&rsquo;t wanted to tire him the day before. But now it
was different. There were a number of things she
knew she mustn&rsquo;t keep from him any longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nightmares are sometimes caused by something
hidden in the subconscious mind,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure I don&rsquo;t know what you have hidden there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter! I&rsquo;m not hiding it on purpose. I feel
silly telling you about it after all you&rsquo;ve been
through,&rdquo; Judy burst out impulsively. &ldquo;Will you forgive
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On one condition,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>Judy thought he was serious until she saw the
twinkle in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is that condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you tell me more. You told me yesterday
that the patient you visited wasn&rsquo;t Clarissa, but you
didn&rsquo;t tell me much of anything else. What happened
to this phantom friend, as you call her?&rdquo; Peter asked
curiously. &ldquo;Begin at the beginning and tell me exactly
how you met her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;We met her&mdash;in a restaurant. We went back there
yesterday but didn&rsquo;t find out anything.&rdquo; Judy sighed.
It was good to be telling Peter about it. She had so
much to tell him that she thought she might as well
dish it out in small doses. The big surprise would
come when she handed him the post office box number
of the thief he had been trailing. But that could wait.
She told him about church first, and how the minister
had said, &ldquo;Love ye therefore the stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was easy to like Clarissa,&rdquo; she continued in answer
to his first request. &ldquo;You asked how we met her.
Well, the four of us were having lunch when there was
a commotion at the cashier&rsquo;s desk, and this stranger&mdash;we
found out later that her name was Clarissa Valentine.
Well, anyway, she claimed that she had given the
cashier a twenty-dollar bill. He opened the cash
drawer to prove that her bill wasn&rsquo;t in it, but she insisted
and we believed her. Was that wrong, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I might have believed the
girl myself and suspected the cashier of palming the
bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m glad we believed her. Not that it makes
what happened afterwards any easier to explain,&rdquo;
Judy added. &ldquo;Pauline thought she had tricked us,
but that was after she disappeared with the money we
lent her. I don&rsquo;t know how she could have vanished
the way she did if it wasn&rsquo;t a trick. Besides, the things
she said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; asked Peter, more interested in the
story than Judy had expected him to be. &ldquo;If you can
remember exactly what she said it may help us find
out what happened to her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no! I&rsquo;m afraid not. So much happened!
This is going to sound unbelievable to you,&rdquo; cried
Judy, &ldquo;but she said things that made it seem almost as
if she&mdash;she didn&rsquo;t exist. Things like telling us she looked
in a mirror once and saw no reflection. And then&mdash;you
won&rsquo;t believe this at all, but when we toured
Radio City and looked at ourselves on television, all
the rest of us showed, but Clarissa was nothing but a
big white light closing in until it disappeared just the
way she did&mdash;without a trace. We called her a phantom
friend for a joke at first, but after that it seemed
so real it wasn&rsquo;t funny any more. Peter, what do you
think happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for one thing, a tube probably blew out on
the TV set. That would cause the picture to close in
and disappear. I&rsquo;ve seen it happen myself, and it is
weird&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly was that,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;I suppose
a tube could have blown out. We didn&rsquo;t wait to see
what was wrong with the set, because Clarissa fainted.
She wasn&rsquo;t faking, either. She was really frightened.
We went back and saw ourselves after the set was
fixed, but she wouldn&rsquo;t go near it. She said her hair
was dull and drab and then we all started saying it&mdash;as
if we were hypnotized or something. Was that a
trick? Was Clarissa playing some sort of confidence
game?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone was. I&rsquo;ll have to look into this myself,&rdquo;
declared Peter. &ldquo;It may tie in with what we found out.
There are all kinds of thieves, you know. That cashier
is probably a petty thief and should be reported. A
thief like Clarence Lawson plays his confidence game
for bigger winnings. But the most insidious kind, I
think, are thieves of the mind. Do you follow
me, Angel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard of brain washing, of course. I wish someone
would wash those golden-haired people out of my
brain, so I could stop dreaming about them and think
straight. Is that what you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean they may have been deliberately put there
by the enemies of our most precious possession. You
know what it is, don&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s our freedom to think
our own thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;oh, Peter! I do see what you mean!&rdquo;
cried Judy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it was done, but someone
has been doing things to our subconscious minds&mdash;to
frighten us&mdash;and make us dream. Clarissa was
frightened, too. She couldn&rsquo;t have done it. But who
was it, Peter? How do we find out who did this horrible
thing to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One way,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;is to review the facts. Judy,
I&rsquo;m serious. I want you to go back over everything
that happened Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve been doing that. We haven&rsquo;t come up
with very many answers, only more questions. You
said what happened to Clarissa might tie in with what
you found out. What did you mean?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you we overheard some plans,&rdquo; Peter began.
&ldquo;Mind manipulation could have been part of them. If
only we knew the name of the missing actress&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is some actress missing? Maybe Irene knows her,&rdquo;
Judy suggested. &ldquo;She could give you the names of all
the people who appeared on her show. There was the
witch. She could have cast some sort of hypnotic
spell over us, I suppose. Hypnotism is one sort of
mind manipulation, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there are other sorts. There&rsquo;s a machine,
for instance, called the tachistoscope. It&rsquo;s sort of a
magic lantern with a high-speed shutter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were a lot of machines,&rdquo; Judy interrupted.
&ldquo;The studio floor was filled up with them. I tried to
remember their names when we were on the tour, but
I couldn&rsquo;t possibly remember them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else happened on that tour?&rdquo; asked Peter.
&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much to tell. I can&rsquo;t think of it all at
once. Irene invited Francine Dow to be her guest
star. Did I tell you she didn&rsquo;t arrive until the last
minute?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Then she left hurriedly with
her aunt before we had a chance to meet her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet the aunt?&rdquo; Peter questioned. &ldquo;A
phony aunt would fit in very nicely with what we
already know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know? I can see you&rsquo;re not free to
tell me,&rdquo; Judy added when Peter was silent. &ldquo;But that
doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m not free to think about it. These
thieves of the mind may invent machines to make me
dream, but when I&rsquo;m awake I intend to do my own
thinking, and right now I think Francine Dow may
be in danger. She didn&rsquo;t sing. Irene thought she had a
cold. But maybe something else was wrong. I didn&rsquo;t
tell you, but there was an argument in the film storage
room. The projectionist was very angry. I heard
him say something might be as dangerous as an atom
bomb. I had no idea what the danger was, but if
Francine Dow is missing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy stopped. It wasn&rsquo;t Francine Dow, it was
Clarissa Valentine who was missing. The two girls,
as she remembered them, were somewhat alike. The
absurd idea came to her that one of them could have
been real and the other a changeling. But Peter didn&rsquo;t
want fairy tales. He wanted facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />Uncovering the Facts</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; Judy said after a little silence, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
looking for facts, and I do have something that may
help you uncover them. It&rsquo;s&mdash;right here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She handed him the slip of paper she had been
saving and told him what it was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawson&rsquo;s post office box number!&rdquo; exclaimed
Peter. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it. You should be working for
us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For you, Peter,&rdquo; she interrupted quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get this little piece of paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was handed to me by a fat woman who peered
at me from behind a shattered glass door&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy, you didn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I found his name on the
back of the church calendar, and Pauline told me
where he lived. He was gone, of course. The people
in the church don&rsquo;t know their building fund money
went with him, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do now,&rdquo; Peter said, handing her the paper
he had been reading when she came in. An item on
the second page told only part of the story.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Boy Held in Shooting of FBI Agent Pleads
Guilty in Kidnap Plot</span>, the headlines ran. Underneath
it told how Frederick H. Christie, sixteen, of
New York, arrested for the shooting of an FBI agent,
pleaded guilty but refused to give any information
that would lead to the apprehension of Clarence Lawson,
who was wanted in a dozen states for extortion
and robbery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the box number I gave you lead to his
apprehension?&rdquo; asked Judy when she had finished
reading the newspaper account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can have the box watched. Maybe we can
nab him when he comes for his mail. I&rsquo;ll be out of
here in a day or two. Then we can really go to work
on it. In the meantime perhaps we can uncover a few
more facts. The so-called plot never got beyond the
talking stage, the boy said. We may have scared them
off. Since it didn&rsquo;t happen I guess I&rsquo;m at liberty to
tell you about it,&rdquo; Peter continued. &ldquo;I think Lawson
planned to bring the victim to his home and then
changed his mind. We heard him say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll hold the
actress until her husband comes across with a donation.&rsquo;
That&rsquo;s the way Lawson operates. His charities
are all legitimate. People are asked to make donations
on the theory that they may be helped because they
have been helpers. Someone is missing. A donation is
made, and the missing person promptly returns. It&rsquo;s
one of the slickest ransom schemes anybody has yet
devised. Somehow they work it so that the victim is
never held against his will. Some worried relative
donates money to a worthy cause. No law is broken
until the money disappears. By then Lawson or one
of his business partners is off for parts unknown.
We would have nabbed him this time if bedlam hadn&rsquo;t
broken loose in the street outside his house. It was
staged to look like a rumble between two rival street
gangs in which we were just accidentally involved.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;Nobody will believe
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People do believe some surprising things. I&rsquo;m no
prophet,&rdquo; he said grimly, &ldquo;but I predict the boys will
get long sentences and Lawson will go scot free. It&rsquo;s
happened that way before. He&rsquo;s one of the slickest
criminals in the United States. I don&rsquo;t know who this
actress was or how they planned to make her disappear,
but they were counting on the fact that her
husband would be worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her husband? Oh dear!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed. &ldquo;Irene
is married. I ought to warn her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, please, don&rsquo;t alarm her,&rdquo; Peter interrupted.
&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t happen the way they planned. I&rsquo;m sure of
that. It was supposed to take place Saturday night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Saturday night that Clarissa disappeared.
But she isn&rsquo;t an actress, and she isn&rsquo;t married.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>&ldquo;And she isn&rsquo;t a phantom,&rdquo; Peter added. &ldquo;Whatever
else we know about her, we can be perfectly
sure she&rsquo;s real. She may be in real danger, too. If I
can&rsquo;t find Lawson I want the confidence men who
are working with him. This is no small outfit. It appears
to be a nationwide organization. We want the
top men, not just the tough kids they hire to do the
shooting for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think they were hired?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know they were following orders. Their
minds, in some way, had been taken over by the minds
of the criminals who gave those orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; Judy was quiet a moment. Did these mind
manipulators have, in their possession, some fiendish
machine more dangerous than an atom bomb? It was
a terrifying thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;what about Irene? Why didn&rsquo;t
she have a nightmare like Pauline and Flo and me?
Irene told me this morning that she hadn&rsquo;t dreamed
an unpleasant thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she on the tour with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;d gone to her rehearsal. We didn&rsquo;t see her
again until it was time for the show. There were a lot
of people we didn&rsquo;t know on the tour with us,&rdquo; Judy
remembered. &ldquo;There was an ad man from Flo&rsquo;s office,
too. He was the one who quarreled with Mr.
Lenz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Lenz?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;The projectionist. Irene&rsquo;s show isn&rsquo;t all live, you
know. Sometimes they run film strips. Nearly all the
commercials are on film. The show is sponsored by a
tooth paste company now, but she&rsquo;s thinking of getting
a new sponsor so she can be on one of the big
networks. It would be almost like having her visit us
every Saturday evening in our home. She was against
it at first,&rdquo; Judy went on. &ldquo;Flo asked me to talk her
into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Irene knows what&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared Judy.
&ldquo;I still can&rsquo;t imagine her saying she uses a product
when she doesn&rsquo;t. And she&rsquo;d never use golden hair
wash. She hates the idea of everybody being blond as
much as I do. Imagine it, Peter! No more black or
brown hair. No more dark blondes like Clarissa and
Honey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no more redheads. We couldn&rsquo;t let <i>that</i> happen!&rdquo;
Peter exclaimed.</p>
<p>Judy gave him one of her special smiles. Gray
eyes met blue ones in a moment of understanding.
Then she said, &ldquo;I want to help. I&rsquo;ll begin by making
a list of the things we did Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Pauline and Flo to go over it with you,&rdquo;
Peter suggested. &ldquo;Then call up Irene. I would call
her myself. They&rsquo;ve given me a telephone right here
at my bedside. But it would be better if you made the
call from the booth outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll I say? I&rsquo;m so mixed up at this point I&rsquo;m
not sure what I&rsquo;m trying to find out. Am I supposed
to ask her about Clarissa or this unknown actress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re trying to find out about that redheaded
patient upstairs, for one thing,&rdquo; Peter told her. &ldquo;Ask
Irene to come in and pay her a visit. She may know
who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER XX</span>
<br />Identified</h2>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s list, when she finally had it completed, was
as long as Santa&rsquo;s list of good boys and girls. That
was what she told Peter when she presented it to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pauline and Flo helped me. We put in everything
we could think of in the order it all happened. But
still I have a feeling there&rsquo;s something important that
we left out. Irene&rsquo;s coming this evening,&rdquo; Judy added
hopefully. &ldquo;Maybe she has something to add to the
list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much later, when Peter was being interviewed by
one of the agents from the New York office and Judy
had stepped outside his room for a moment, she almost
bumped into Irene. For a moment they stared at each
other. Then both of them said, in the same breath,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re here!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dale&rsquo;s here, too,&rdquo; Irene told her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s outside in
the waiting room with little Judy. We&rsquo;ll take turns
minding her so both of us can visit Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait. He has a visitor. Very confidential,&rdquo;
Judy said, lowering her voice. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
looking over a list that I gave them. Nobody is allowed
in there until they&rsquo;ve finished exchanging top
secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go up and visit Clarissa and find out
what happened&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, Irene!&rdquo; Judy stopped her. &ldquo;I should have
told you. That patient isn&rsquo;t Clarissa. I don&rsquo;t know
who she is, but you may be able to identify her. She
keeps calling for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Irene looked her disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She could be someone who&rsquo;s seen me on television&mdash;someone
I don&rsquo;t know at all. Doesn&rsquo;t she know
who she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she out of her head? I&rsquo;ve never been able to
overcome my fear of people who weren&rsquo;t&mdash;rational,&rdquo;
Irene confessed. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t someone else identify her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants you, Irene. She keeps asking for the
Golden Girl. She was hurt on the way to see your
show, and the idea seems fixed in her mind. She may
calm down the minute she sees you,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Irene paused, glancing back toward
Peter&rsquo;s room. His visitor, portfolio in hand, had just
come out. &ldquo;We can go in now,&rdquo; she told Judy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather not visit that woman upstairs until I&rsquo;ve seen
Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment, Mr. Blake!&rdquo; Peter called from his
room. &ldquo;Here are a couple of young ladies I want you
to meet. They may have something to add to that list
I just gave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He introduced the man to Judy and Irene. They
greeted him cordially, and then Judy said, &ldquo;I have
nothing to add, Mr. Blake. If anything else happened
I can&rsquo;t think of it, but Mrs. Meredith may have something
for you. She&rsquo;s on her way to identify that red-haired
woman who was hurt in the taxicab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going up, but I probably won&rsquo;t know her
from Adam,&rdquo; Irene said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Eve,&rdquo; Peter corrected her with a boyish grin.
&ldquo;Is Dale here? Maybe he might have a clue to her
identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had somebody to mind the baby in the waiting
room, we could both go up,&rdquo; Irene began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mind her,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;Is it all right, Peter?
I won&rsquo;t be long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Peter
surprised Judy by saying. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m supposed to walk
around and get used to this cast. It makes me feel a
little top-heavy right now. You&rsquo;ll have to help me on
with my robe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy smiled. It was so good to see Peter up and
walking. She escorted him to the waiting room where
little Judy had to be stopped from pouncing on him.
The baby stared at the cast and then said sorrowfully,
&ldquo;Peter all broke.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;How does she mean that?&rdquo; asked Dale. &ldquo;Good to
see you so chipper,&rdquo; he added, shaking the hand that
Peter extended. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always heard that you can&rsquo;t
keep a good man down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Blake was introduced and invited to accompany
Dale and Irene to the room in the old building where
the red-haired woman was. They left quietly just as
Peter was saying to little Judy, &ldquo;I guess I must look
something like a broken dolly to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; little Judy corrected him. Irene had
brought along one of little Judy&rsquo;s &ldquo;babies&rdquo; to keep
her amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dolly can also be a truck used for television
cameras,&rdquo; Judy remarked. &ldquo;You learn a whole new
language. A chair becomes a prop, and a log is no
longer something to throw in the fireplace. It&rsquo;s a complete
record of everything that happens on a station
from sign-on in the morning to sign-off at midnight.
I might remember what I forgot to put on that list if
I looked at the station log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do that,&rdquo; advised Peter. &ldquo;There may have been
something to make you dream&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On television?&rdquo; Judy laughed. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what it was unless that witch gave me nightmares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny witch!&rdquo; spoke up little Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Judy pointed out, &ldquo;she was a funny
witch. She wasn&rsquo;t frightening even to a baby. The
whole play was delightful. Did you see the reviews of
it? Nobody seemed to recognize Francine Dow.
Little Judy is holding the doll&mdash;excuse me, I mean
the baby, that played the part of Sleeping Beauty during
the first part of the show. They also used a film
strip of a real baby.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>&ldquo;The advertising was on film, too, wasn&rsquo;t it? That&rsquo;s
one thing you did omit from your list,&rdquo; Peter pointed
out. &ldquo;You forgot to list the commercials you
watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The commercials! Who could list them? There are
so many of them. Anyway, they aren&rsquo;t important.
But maybe they are,&rdquo; Judy quickly amended her first
statement. &ldquo;That golden hair wash commercial started
us worrying about our hair. We watched it when we
were waiting for the tour to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Radio City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it didn&rsquo;t originate from there. It was on a
local channel. You know, the same one that features
the Golden Girl show. I wish you could have been
there, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps that&rsquo;s where I should have been. There
are federal controls to keep advertisers in line. If I
had known&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where Mommy Daddy gone?&rdquo; little Judy interrupted,
suddenly realizing that Dale and Irene were
no longer in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went to call on a patient,&rdquo; Judy explained
hurriedly. She was eager to hear the rest of what
Peter had started to say, but again the baby interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wanna see patient!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a patient. You&rsquo;re visiting me,&rdquo; Peter told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sick,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautifully mended,&rdquo; Peter agreed, kissing the top
of her curly head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Judy. We&rsquo;ll have to explore
the possibilities another time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Little Judy chattered on. Peter let her examine his
cast. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>hard</i>. Who did &rsquo;at? Scribbles on it,&rdquo; she
observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Autographs,&rdquo; Peter corrected her.</p>
<p>She tried to say the word and made such a funny
<i>o</i> with her mouth that both Judy and Peter had to
laugh. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for a two-year-old to say a big
word like <i>autograph</i>. Any attempt at serious conversation
was abandoned. All three of them were laughing
and saying funny words when Dale and Irene returned.
Mr. Blake was with them. They looked so
serious that even little Judy stopped laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Judy asked at once. &ldquo;Did you
know the patient? Is she all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s&mdash;Oh, Judy! I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; Irene
burst out. &ldquo;She must have been hurt right after the
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Irene. It was during the show.&rdquo; Judy remembered
it distinctly. &ldquo;We heard the ambulance siren
right after Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on the
spindle and the witch pronounced the curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francine Dow played the part of Sleeping Beauty,
didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Peter inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly thought she did,&rdquo; Judy began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; Dale blurted out when
Irene could only gasp in disbelief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Mr. Blake pointed out, &ldquo;we identified
the patient. She&rsquo;s better. She knows her own name,
and Mrs. Meredith is sure of it. <i>She is Francine Dow!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />Explained</h2>
<p>The silence that followed Mr. Blake&rsquo;s announcement
was like the moment after lightning strikes,
when a clap of thunder is expected. It would come
with the whole explanation. But at first Judy couldn&rsquo;t
believe it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand this at all,&rdquo; she heard herself
saying. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t have made a mistake, Irene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Judy. Irene identified her. There&rsquo;s no mistake
unless Clarence Lawson made it when he snatched
the wrong girl. Do you think that could be what
happened?&rdquo; Peter asked the other FBI agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth an investigation,&rdquo; Mr. Blake replied.
&ldquo;This woman is Francine Dow all right. She was on
her way to the theater when she was hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;you can&rsquo;t mean that she never arrived!
Then who was that up there on the stage?
Someone played the part of Sleeping Beauty. Did you
know it wasn&rsquo;t the guest star you invited?&rdquo; Judy
asked, turning to Irene in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;I did think she&rsquo;d
kept her youth and beauty amazingly. But the right
make-up can make a person look very young. I
couldn&rsquo;t see what was going on backstage from
where I was standing. Afterwards, when I saw the
reviews, I suspected there had been a last-minute substitute.
But I still don&rsquo;t know who she was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anybody know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The substitute does. Whoever she was, she played
the part beautifully except for the last song. I did
wonder why she didn&rsquo;t sing. There was an unscheduled
wait when the witch was spinning,&rdquo; Irene said,
&ldquo;but I never guessed Francine Dow wasn&rsquo;t there.
The show would have been ruined if someone
hadn&rsquo;t stepped in to play the part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who was that someone?&rdquo; Judy wanted to
know. &ldquo;And how did she know the lines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were cards,&rdquo; Irene explained. &ldquo;Cards are
often used to prompt busy stars. Francine missed the
rehearsals so we had the cards ready for her. The man
on the dolly held them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby,&rdquo; little Judy corrected Irene drowsily from
Dale&rsquo;s arms, and promptly fell asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could sleep like that without dreaming,&rdquo;
Judy said with a sigh. &ldquo;My dreams are so real I keep
thinking things that are actually happening are part
of them. If I could only think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did all right when you compiled that list your
husband showed me. That shows some pretty clear
thinking,&rdquo; Mr. Blake complimented her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this! If I could think back to the exact time&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re on the
right track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I? It doesn&rsquo;t seem possible. But if the lines
Francine had to say were on the cards, and the wig
and costume were ready, it <i>could</i> have been played by
some other actress. But who was she? Who took the
part of Sleeping Beauty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know it wasn&rsquo;t Francine Dow,&rdquo; Irene said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t one of the fairies. They were
still in costume. I don&rsquo;t see who it could have been
unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused, and Peter said one word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Clarissa!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Peter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the clap of thunder Judy had been expecting.
Somewhere in the back of her mind she had
known it all along. Clarissa, in the golden wig and the
princess costume, had shown her real beauty for
everyone to see. There could have been no doubt,
even in her own mind, that she was a vision of loveliness
on TV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she&rsquo;d do anything to get on television,&rdquo;
Judy remembered. &ldquo;Could she have planned all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how she could,&rdquo; Irene replied. &ldquo;Nobody
possibly could have known Francine Dow
would have an accident. The whole show could have
been spoiled!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t. Clarissa played the part so well that
everybody thought she was Francine Dow. But what
happened afterwards?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Francine&rsquo;s aunt
must have known she wasn&rsquo;t the real Francine&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>If</i> that woman was her aunt,&rdquo; Peter put in, and
suddenly, just as the realization had come that
Clarissa had played the part of Sleeping Beauty, a new
and more terrifying fact became apparent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;Those plans to hold an actress
until her husband gave a &lsquo;donation&rsquo; were meant for
Francine Dow. But if they&rsquo;re holding Clarissa&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped, aghast at the thought of what terror
the girl, so easily frightened, must be feeling in the
hands of Clarence Lawson and his ring of criminals.
They had been desperate enough to use bullets to keep
their plans from being discovered. Peter was aware of
the danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must proceed with caution,&rdquo; he told Mr.
Blake. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s our job to see that the girl isn&rsquo;t hurt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that she&rsquo;s returned to her own people,&rdquo; his
partner added. &ldquo;Where can we get hold of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That proved to be the big question. A minister
somewhere in West Virginia was pretty vague. But
it was enough to trigger the field office there into action.
An ordained minister by the name of Valentine
ought not to be hard to find.</p>
<p>Mr. Blake was ready to leave. He said he would get
back to the office and set the machinery in motion.
Meantime Peter decided to call up Washington, since
every case investigated in the field had to be supervised
and coordinated from FBI headquarters there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get fast action on this,&rdquo; he promised a short
time later, returning from the telephone booth just
outside the waiting room.</p>
<p>Judy could see how difficult it was for him to move
about with the heavy cast on his shoulder, but the
urgency of his case seemed to give him new strength.
She turned to Irene, who still seemed a little baffled
by all that was happening, and said, &ldquo;Poor Peter! I
know how much he wants to get out there in the field,
as he calls it, and do the investigating himself, but he
can&rsquo;t. We mustn&rsquo;t let him try until he&rsquo;s stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Clarissa in danger? I don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s
going on at all,&rdquo; Irene admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us do. But we have to find out. There
seems to have been a plot to kidnap some actress. It
sounds like something out of one of my stories,&rdquo; Dale
said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s only too real.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at the sleeping baby he was holding, and
Judy knew what he was thinking. Until Clarence
Lawson and his ring of criminals were caught, none of
them could be sure who his next victim would be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter&rsquo;s afraid they&rsquo;ve snatched Clarissa, thinking
she was Francine Dow. I don&rsquo;t know how a thing like
that could happen. Why would she have gone with
them without a protest? Let&rsquo;s go back over everything
that happened,&rdquo; Judy suggested. &ldquo;Mr. Lenz
knows something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame him for anything. He&rsquo;s the kindest,
best man,&rdquo; Irene began to defend him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not questioning his character,&rdquo; Judy told her.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just remembering what he said. Something in that
film storage room was dangerous. &lsquo;As dangerous as an
atom bomb,&rsquo; he said, and I think that something,
whatever it is, may be a clue to what happened to
Clarissa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Francine Dow? Why wasn&rsquo;t she reported
missing? Didn&rsquo;t anybody care about her? She
has a husband. She does try to conceal her age. She
used to look a lot like Clarissa when she was a movie
star. Now, with her hair dyed that weird shade of
red and her face&mdash;Judy, it was a yellowish color. She
looked terrible. I asked the nurse and she said Francine
is in bad shape. I guess it&rsquo;s something pretty serious,&rdquo;
Irene finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And worry never helps. I&rsquo;ve heard Dad say that,&rdquo;
Judy remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to tell her the show wasn&rsquo;t spoiled. It did
quiet her a little,&rdquo; Irene said. &ldquo;I suppose, now that
they know who she is, the hospital will get in touch
with her husband. Everything is out of our hands,
Judy. We may as well go home and get a little rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy hoped she could rest without a whole parade
of faceless golden-haired people swarming in to haunt
her dreams. Flo had dreamed. So had Pauline. But
what of Clarissa? Was there really something in that
golden hair wash commercial to make them dream?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You started to tell me something, Peter,&rdquo; Judy
began. &ldquo;You said there were federal controls to keep
advertisers in line&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t enough, I&rsquo;m afraid. The big networks
have banned this kind of advertising, but some
of the local channels may be using it,&rdquo; Peter said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;Advertising? But Mr. Lenz said, &lsquo;as dangerous as
an atom bomb,&rsquo;&rdquo; Judy objected. &ldquo;I thought he was
talking about something that might blow up in our
faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind control is equally dangerous. Think about
it,&rdquo; Peter advised. &ldquo;Talk with this projectionist if you
have a chance. We want to know exactly what you
four girls saw on television.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />Real Phantoms</h2>
<p>&ldquo;So these are our suspects?&rdquo; Judy looked about at
the array of machinery in the area just in front of
the studio floor. It was the next day. She had come
with Irene to rehearsal. To all appearances she was
simply an interested friend, but Mr. Lenz knew, the
moment he saw her, that she had come for another
purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the papers,&rdquo; he said to Irene. &ldquo;I know
your friend is missing, and I can tell you something
about what happened backstage last Saturday. I was
standing at the door to the film storage room and saw
it all. She came back here during intermission. Your
guest star hadn&rsquo;t arrived, and everybody was all excited.
When they saw this girl you call Clarissa
Valentine they jumped to the conclusion that she was
Francine Dow and brought out the wig and costume.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo; It was clear to Judy what had happened.
&ldquo;Clarissa said she came to New York hoping to get a
little part on TV. That was the way she put it. The
part she got wasn&rsquo;t so little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was there when she was needed,&rdquo; Irene put
in, &ldquo;but how did she happen to go backstage in the
first place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can answer that question,&rdquo; Judy said.
&ldquo;She went back for those two bottles of shampoo she
left in the dressing room, and when she saw Francine
Dow wasn&rsquo;t there, she stepped into the part because
she didn&rsquo;t want the show spoiled and because&mdash;well,
it does happen that sometimes one person&rsquo;s failure is
another&rsquo;s opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Lenz.
&ldquo;That girl can really act. With all the publicity she&rsquo;ll
get when she is located, she&rsquo;s sure to be in demand,
and I don&rsquo;t mean just for spot advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of advertising,&rdquo; Judy began as if it had
just come up casually in the conversation, &ldquo;there was
a commercial on this channel last Saturday&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean the golden hair wash commercial, it
won&rsquo;t be shown again. I can promise you that,&rdquo; the
projectionist went on, becoming excited. &ldquo;I know why
you&rsquo;ve come. I could see you were curious. Well, that
young ad man had talked somebody here into showing
that film, phantoms and all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phantoms?&rdquo; The word burst from Judy&rsquo;s lips.
&ldquo;What phantoms, Mr. Lenz?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Mr. Lenz, perching on his counter
like an angry bird, &ldquo;will take a little explaining.&rdquo; He
waved his hand toward the pigeonholes behind him,
where rows upon rows of film were stored for future
use on the program. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my job to bring the contents
of those cans to life. There&rsquo;s everything there&mdash;spot
commercials, feature films, half-hour shows&mdash;everything.
People who watch these films know what
they&rsquo;re watching. If they don&rsquo;t like the program they
can turn it off. If the commercial displeases them they
can always walk out of the room until it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is something being fed
into your mind without your knowledge and without
your consent. You can&rsquo;t turn it off because you don&rsquo;t
know you&rsquo;re watching it until, suddenly, you feel
compelled to buy some product or, worse yet, you&rsquo;re
plagued with guilt because you didn&rsquo;t buy it. This is
called subliminal advertising, and it&rsquo;s forbidden&mdash;just
as it should be. Only once has it been used on this
channel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that last Saturday, Mr. Lenz? Was it shown
on Teen Time Party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Superimposed on the picture of the golden-haired
girl you saw was another picture&mdash;a shadowy,
faceless figure which the advertiser wished you to
imagine was yourself. This phantom was flashed on
the screen too fast for your conscious mind to be
aware of it. But your subconscious mind recorded it.
And a desire was planted. You began to want to be
like the beautiful golden-haired girl rather than the
faceless shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>&ldquo;I dreamed of faceless people,&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;They
had golden hair, and they were all alike. They frightened
me, Mr. Lenz. I couldn&rsquo;t get them out of my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you associate them with such words as <i>drab</i>
and <i>dull</i>?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Clarissa kept saying about her hair.
I thought&mdash;we all thought she&rsquo;d hypnotized us in
some way. Why? Were those words flashed on television,
too? Were all those queer feelings we couldn&rsquo;t
explain the result of that program we watched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they were, my dear. But the film will
not be shown again. I can promise you that. Erase it
from your memory, if you can. But remember! Those
faceless phantoms could be real if we once lost our
freedom to think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped, as if spent by his outburst, and Irene
said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll remember, won&rsquo;t we, Judy? This has certainly
been a lesson for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Irene?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;d just about decided to do the golden
hair wash commercial. That is, I thought if Clarissa
used the stuff, she could do the commercial for me.
And with all the publicity she&rsquo;ll be getting, people
will be eager to see her. But now that I know that
sponsor uses subliminal advertising, I wouldn&rsquo;t think
of working for those people,&rdquo; Irene exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, Mrs. Meredith,&rdquo; Mr. Lenz observed,
&ldquo;if the golden hair wash people don&rsquo;t give up the use
of subliminal advertising, no major network will have
anything to do with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Irene sighed. &ldquo;And I did so want to
be on one of the big networks. It isn&rsquo;t just the extra
money. It&rsquo;s being able to entertain so many more people&mdash;especially
you,&rdquo; she confided with a fond look at
Judy. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see me on your TV at home until
I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame,&rdquo; Judy sympathized. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll get
there sooner or later. And when you do, I hope you&rsquo;ll
repeat <i>Sleeping Beauty</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; Irene said, &ldquo;but how can I unless we
find Clarissa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy shook her head. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t anything, not
even a picture of her for the papers, and so far they
haven&rsquo;t been able to locate any minister named Valentine
in West Virginia. Peter says it&rsquo;s probably not her
real name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her,&rdquo; Mr. Lenz said. &ldquo;But if she goes on
the air for golden hair wash, she&rsquo;ll be giving up more
than she can possibly gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter said there were thieves of the mind,&rdquo; Judy
said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m beginning to understand what he meant.
You wouldn&rsquo;t know it if they flashed those faceless
phantoms on a film you had made. It would be their
film, wouldn&rsquo;t it? They could do that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without warning the viewers,&rdquo; Mr. Lenz interrupted.
&ldquo;The public does have that much protection.
The technique has been used in horror films, but
the viewers have been warned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warned of what?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Were they told
that the film would give them nightmares?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. As I told that young ad man, it&rsquo;s still in the
experimental stage. It&rsquo;s dangerous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>&ldquo;As dangerous as an atom bomb. That&rsquo;s what you
said,&rdquo; Judy reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; declared the projectionist, &ldquo;is exactly
what I meant. The day a man&rsquo;s thinking can be controlled
without his knowledge will be the day that
marks the end of freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Judy. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t let that happen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lenz gave Judy&rsquo;s hand such a grip that she
winced, but afterwards it was good to remember.
And there were no more nightmares, for Judy at least.
After she had talked it over with Peter she knew
exactly what had happened and what they had yet to
do.</p>

<br />A Curious Letter</h2>
<p>Shortly after Peter was discharged from the
hospital, a letter came, addressed to Irene and postmarked
Roulsville. It bore no return address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. It was forwarded to me from the
studio,&rdquo; Irene said, turning it over in her hand. &ldquo;My
show is on a local channel. I don&rsquo;t have any fans in
Roulsville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know some people there, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>Irene shook her head. &ldquo;Only you and your family.
But they live in Farringdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace could have been driving through Roulsville,&rdquo;
Judy said, &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t his handwriting. Anyway,
he usually types&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter interrupted, his blue eyes twinkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best way to find out who the letter is from
is to open it,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Dale laughed. &ldquo;Why make such a mystery out of
an ordinary letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you say an ordinary letter? This isn&rsquo;t&mdash;it can&rsquo;t
be, but it is!&rdquo; Irene exclaimed as she tore open the
envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t making any sense,&rdquo; Judy began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does this make sense?&rdquo; Irene waved four crisp
five-dollar bills before her face. &ldquo;Clarissa sent them!
She returned our money. Oh, Judy! I can&rsquo;t believe
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; Judy agreed. &ldquo;How does Clarissa
happen to be in Roulsville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till I read the letter,&rdquo; Irene said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s directed
to all four of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s bewilderment grew as Irene read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Irene, Judy, Flo, and Pauline:</p>
<p>Enclosed are four five-dollar bills. Thank you for helping
me, a perfect stranger. Do good and gain good, my
father always says. Trust people and you will be trusted.
Please tell the police and the FBI that I am safe at home
and they can stop looking for me. I saw it all in the papers.
Dad thinks I ought to give up the idea of a career on
TV until I&rsquo;ve finished high school here in Roulsville. I
am sorry I had to leave the theater in such a hurry, but
Francine Dow&rsquo;s aunt mistook me for her. I convinced her
of her mistake and went home only to find that my parents
were moving. I told you Dad used to be a minister,
didn&rsquo;t I? He doesn&rsquo;t have a pastorate at present, but hopes
to become active in church work. What church do you
attend, Judy? I remember hearing you say you lived
somewhere in the vicinity of Roulsville. We&rsquo;ve bought a
beautiful home here....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they have,&rdquo; Peter commented, reading over
Irene&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Clarence Lawson has enough cash
to buy a real beaut&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarence Lawson!&rdquo; exclaimed Judy. &ldquo;What are
you saying, Peter? Clarissa&rsquo;s with her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the letter says. But did Clarissa write it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does sound a little stilted,&rdquo; Judy admitted. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m not familiar with her handwriting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am familiar with some of those sayings she
attributes to her father. <i>Do good and gain good</i>, for
instance. Lawson&rsquo;s overworked that one. Those were
the very words he used when he approached Francine
Dow&rsquo;s husband for a donation. Dow and Francine had
quarreled over her comeback on TV, and she&rsquo;d left
him to live with an aunt who had just come east from
California.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you interview the aunt?&rdquo; asked Dale. &ldquo;Or
aren&rsquo;t you at liberty to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t. I checked with our field office there. The
real aunt is still in California. Lawson had found out
about her, some way. The &lsquo;aunt&rsquo; who called at the
stage door and left with Clarissa really did mistake
her for Francine Dow. That&rsquo;s one fact that is straight
in the letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the others? She says she&rsquo;s living with her
parents in Roulsville. Aren&rsquo;t these people really her
parents? It is odd she didn&rsquo;t mention her brothers and
sisters. Didn&rsquo;t she say she was one of six children?&rdquo;
Judy asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear her say that. I didn&rsquo;t hear her say a
lot of the queer things you girls said she said when you
were on that tour of Radio City,&rdquo; Irene replied. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t hear her call herself a changeling, for instance,
or say she looked in the mirror and saw no reflection.
Maybe she is trying to trick us after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t Clarissa. It&rsquo;s Lawson who&rsquo;s trying to trick
us,&rdquo; declared Peter, &ldquo;but this time he won&rsquo;t get away
with it. He&rsquo;s picked you for a sucker because you
lent money to a stranger. I can&rsquo;t wait to see the look
on his face when he finds out who you really are,
Angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean when he finds out I&rsquo;m married to an
FBI man,&rdquo; Judy laughed. &ldquo;Peter, when can we leave
for home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had planned to return to Pennsylvania in a
day or two, anyway. The letter made their return
more urgent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave tomorrow morning,&rdquo; Peter suggested.
&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better call your mother and ask her to
open up the house. Otherwise it will be pretty cold.
And I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to do most of the driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beetle had come through the gun battle with
one small dent in its fender. That was repaired, and
the car now looked like new. A few telephone calls
were made and then the packing began. The following
morning, Judy and Peter were on their way home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like New York much,&rdquo; Judy admitted
when they were out of the city, &ldquo;especially Madison
Avenue and what Flo calls the rat race to get a
monopoly on all the big accounts. I don&rsquo;t want anything
big. I guess I&rsquo;m just a country girl at heart.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;My love for you is as big as all outdoors,&rdquo; declared
Peter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car went into a wild skid. Judy righted it and
said, &ldquo;There! Of course I want your love, but from
now on I&rsquo;m paying strict attention to my driving. All
outdoors is pretty big this morning. We have three
hundred miles of icy roads ahead of us with who
knows what at the other end. Peter, take care this
time, won&rsquo;t you? Please don&rsquo;t be alone when you
meet Clarence Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He promised that he wouldn&rsquo;t be alone. He had
seen to that. He also told Judy he would soon be
leaving for Washington. &ldquo;I need that refresher course.
A fellow has to keep in training to be able to defend
himself against such men,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;I know
how Lawson works, but I want to be prepared for
his little surprises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he work?&rdquo; asked Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes people like him for one thing. He looks
and acts like a perfect gentleman. He and his wife are
just the type of people you expect to see in church on
a Sunday morning. With a lovely young &lsquo;daughter&rsquo;
like Clarissa to cover up for him, nobody will believe
he isn&rsquo;t the real Pastor Valentine. He may get himself
elected treasurer of the church as he did some years
ago when he was known as David Barnes. I see what
his plans are all right, but this time,&rdquo; Peter said with
a determined look on his face, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to nip
them right in the bud. It&rsquo;s too bad Clarissa didn&rsquo;t put
her street address on that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Roulsville isn&rsquo;t so big. Can&rsquo;t you check with the
real estate office and find out who&rsquo;s bought property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the usual procedure,&rdquo; agreed Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
check with the churches, too. We&rsquo;ll find him if I have
to canvass every house. It looks as if this case is going
to wind up fast. Roulsville, of all places! Lady Luck
has certainly smiled on us for once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it Lady Luck or good clear thinking on
Clarissa&rsquo;s part?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say what she
meant in that letter, but I could read between the
lines. I know your work is secret and I shouldn&rsquo;t talk
about it, but if Clarissa did happen to overhear our
conversation in the restaurant she may know you&rsquo;re
with the FBI. That letter could be her way of asking
for help without arousing the suspicions of her so-called
parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Angel. Clarissa isn&rsquo;t the only one
who&rsquo;s been doing some good clear thinking,&rdquo; declared
Peter. &ldquo;Your nightmares haven&rsquo;t affected your thought
processes in the daytime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have them any more. I wonder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s wonderings went on for mile after mile of
uninterrupted driving. Were things falling into place
too neatly? Certainly someone had planned this. Could
it be Clarence Lawson himself? Had he dictated that
letter and forced Clarissa to write it?</p>
<p>As they neared home Peter expressed what Judy
had been thinking. &ldquo;I wonder what Lawson is up to
this time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Does he really think Clarissa will
keep on pretending to be his daughter? He may have
threatened her into leading us right into his trap.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />Trapped!</h2>
<p>With Judy still at the wheel, the Beetle crawled
down the last hill and into the valley that held the
small city of Farringdon. They stopped at Dr. Bolton&rsquo;s
house on Grove Street only to find it deserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother may have gone over to Dry Brook Hollow
to get our house ready for us, but Dad should be
here. He has office hours from six to eight in the
evening,&rdquo; Judy said in a worried voice, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s almost
six o&rsquo;clock now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We made good time. You must be tired. Let&rsquo;s
drive right home to Dry Brook Hollow,&rdquo; Peter suggested.
&ldquo;Someone is sure to be there. Tomorrow I&rsquo;ll
report at the resident agency and get my assignment.
Lawson knows me. The SAC may want someone else
to do the footwork.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>The SAC, Judy knew, was the Supervising Agent
in charge of the nearest field office. There were fifty
or more such offices scattered throughout the country,
and every one of them had been advised to be on the
lookout for Clarence Lawson as well as for Clarissa.
In the smaller cities surrounding the field offices the
men worked out of resident agencies like the one
recently set up in Farringdon, but they were still responsible
to the SAC who, in turn, was responsible to
the chief himself. It awed Judy when she thought of
all the complicated machinery that had been set in
motion to see that no harm came to one girl. It made
her proud, too, that Peter was part of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind?&rdquo; she asked him as they drove on
over the next hill and down into Dry Brook Hollow.
&ldquo;I mean, would you mind very much if David Trent
or some other more experienced agent got the assignment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; Peter admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather like to bring
Lawson in myself. If only he hasn&rsquo;t used Clarissa as
bait for a trap&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Peter! That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been thinking. Could
it be&mdash;mind control? There seem to be so many ways
of doing it. There&rsquo;s brain washing, and hypnotic suggestion,
and high-pressure selling, and all the frightening
new inventions for getting ideas into a person&rsquo;s
subconscious mind without his knowledge or consent.
It scares me when I think of the possibilities&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are possibilities for good as well as evil,&rdquo;
Peter told her. &ldquo;Another type of mind control has
been used to reform prisoners, and it seems to work.
Their pillows talk to them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Oh&mdash;&rdquo; she
interrupted herself, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a man turning down our
road. Maybe it&rsquo;s just as well he didn&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can drive down the North Hollow road, take
that short-cut through the woods, and head him off.
Want to?&rdquo; asked Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems silly,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;but I think I do
want to. Look, Peter!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed a few minutes
later, as she stopped the car and they both climbed
out. &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s broken a path through here. It should
be easy to head him off. I&rsquo;ll run ahead and meet him
before he gets to the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; Peter called, but Judy was already running.
As she passed her house she thought she heard someone
else call to her. Lights blazed from almost every
window, so she knew her mother must be there.</p>
<p>Just before she reached the bridge Judy slowed
down and caught her breath before she approached
the oncoming stranger. He was taking his time, apparently
in no hurry to reach the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; Judy called out bravely. &ldquo;Are you on your
way to our house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greetings and salutations!&rdquo; said the stranger, bowing
politely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Pastor Valentine. You must be
Judy. My daughter, Clarissa, has invited me to your
party. I believe you know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know her,&rdquo; Judy said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not giving
a party. Or am I?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>For a moment she almost believed the man was the
real Pastor Valentine. But in the next moment the
terrifying realization swept over her. He was Clarence
Lawson! She smiled at him, trying to conceal her
terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be a surprise party. Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;surprised.
I&rsquo;ll walk the rest of the way with you, Pastor Valentine,
and introduce you to my guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t ask if Clarissa was among them. She
could only hope Peter had reached the house in time
to telephone for help. The man, walking beside her,
was the picture of gentlemanly dignity until, suddenly,
a black shape darted in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he exclaimed, losing a little of his
dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my cat. Don&rsquo;t you like cats, Mr. Law&mdash;I mean
Pastor Valentine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy had let the name slip out. She could have
bitten her tongue for it. The man dropped his polite
mask and snarled, &ldquo;I hate cats. They&rsquo;re unlucky, especially
black ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a temptation to tell him that this particular
black cat was unlucky only for criminals, but Judy resisted
the urge as Lawson, recovering his poise, turned
and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for the outburst, but I&rsquo;m allergic
to cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cat&rsquo;s the same way,&rdquo; Judy retorted. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s allergic
to some people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear! You will never make friends saying
things like that. We do want to be friendly, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
he asked in placating tones. &ldquo;After all, I am the father
of a young lady who seems very fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;Then perhaps you can tell
me where the young lady is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s with her mother,&rdquo; was his clipped answer.
&ldquo;Now, if you will excuse me, I must be going&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming to my party? You must live
near here,&rdquo; Judy ventured. &ldquo;I notice you were walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for the constitution,&rdquo; he replied and began
to walk away more swiftly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; cried Judy. She couldn&rsquo;t let him escape. It
had been a mistake to run and meet him in the first
place. And she should never have spoken to him in the
way she did. Now he was nearly to the bridge.
Should she turn back or follow him and try to persuade
him to return?</p>
<p>Judy had forgotten, for the moment, that Peter was
part of an organization far better equipped to deal
with criminals than she was. He was armed, for one
thing, and she was not. She had just decided to follow
Clarence Lawson when suddenly, with a snarl of rage,
he whirled around toward her. Judy saw the gleam
of a gun in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never use that!&rdquo; she gasped, terrified.</p>
<p>He wasn&rsquo;t given time to answer. It was growing
dark, but she could see a figure loom up behind him
and whip the gun from his hand. Scuffling sounds
followed. Judy heard a thud and then a splash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
<p>&ldquo;Peter!&rdquo; she gasped. He had appeared from behind
her. &ldquo;That&mdash;that was Lawson, the man you want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the man we&rsquo;ve got. There&rsquo;s a good
hiding place under the bridge,&rdquo; Peter continued as
two policemen emerged with a dripping Lawson between
them. &ldquo;We walked into a trap all right, but it
was set for a prisoner who can use one of those talking
pillows I was telling you about.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c25"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXV</span>
<br />Real Friends</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What next?&rdquo; asked Judy. Things were happening
so fast she could scarcely keep track of them. &ldquo;I
thought you said&mdash;talking pillows&mdash;before all the excitement
began. Oh, Peter, I was so afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judy, you&rsquo;re shivering! There&rsquo;s no need for you
to be afraid now. Go back to the house,&rdquo; advised
Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll join you there in a few minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>She&rsquo;s</i> shivering! What about me?&rdquo; Lawson snarled
from between chattering teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky we didn&rsquo;t drown you,&rdquo; one of the
police officers told him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
<p>As he was led toward the barn where a police
car was concealed, little pools of water dripped
from his clothing and left a trail behind him in the
melting snow. It had turned warm for January. Judy
had not shivered because of the cold. It was something
else that sent chills through her. Things were too
quiet. Usually, when a man was arrested, there were
wailing sirens and a whole flock of police cars roaring
in from all directions. Here there was nothing but an
ominous silence.</p>
<p>The lights from the house looked friendly, but
there wasn&rsquo;t a sound to prove that anyone was inside.
Only Blackberry, on the porch now, yowled plaintively,
asking to be let in.</p>
<p>Suddenly the door opened. Dr. Bolton was on his
way out. He did have office hours and had waited
only long enough to greet Judy. Her mother and
Horace were just behind him. She heard Honey, somewhere
in the background, saying in a loud stage
whisper, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, girls! All together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surprise!&rdquo; came the chorus of voices as her friends
rushed forward. Clarissa was with them. She hugged
Judy fiercely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to see you,&rdquo; she said in a
strange voice. &ldquo;I told Mother and Father how I met
you. Mother&rsquo;s here&mdash;&rdquo; She indicated Blackberry&rsquo;s
favorite chair where a motherly, gray-haired woman
sat quietly rocking and smiling at the assembled guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t met Mrs. Valentine. Let me introduce
you,&rdquo; Judy&rsquo;s mother began.</p>
<p>Horace gave her a secret sign that meant he knew
and had come, not only as her brother but also as a
reporter for the <i>Farringdon Daily Herald</i>. But, obviously,
Mrs. Bolton had been kept in the dark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Judy heard herself saying something polite instead
of the questions that were tumbling over themselves
in her mind wanting to be asked and answered.</p>
<p>Lois and Lorraine were there. Arthur Farringdon-Pett
hovered protectively behind his sister and his
recent bride. Judy&rsquo;s young neighbor, Holly Potter,
said, &ldquo;I like your friend Clarissa, Judy. I met her at
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; One question was answered. &ldquo;I introduced
her to Horace and Honey,&rdquo; Holly continued,
and the answer came to another question. Judy felt
more secure, suddenly, as she noticed another quiet
guest. He was David Trent from the field office of
the FBI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody has been so friendly,&rdquo; Mrs. Valentine
was telling him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided to join the little
neighborhood church here until my husband has a
call. You know, of course, that he is a minister of the
gospel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gray-haired woman moved uncomfortably in
her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what is keeping him. He promised to
stop in and meet some of the young people. He has
plans for a youth organization&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His plans, whatever they are, will never be carried
out.&rdquo; Mr. Trent brought out his credentials, and the
conversation ended abruptly just as Peter entered the
room and took the woman firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re G-men!&rdquo; she gasped, looking from one of
them to the other. She was not looking for a way to
escape. She could see that there was none.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>Afterwards, when Judy remembered the scene, the
one thing that stood out clearly in her mind was the
fact that Blackberry had been insulted to see a stranger
sitting in his chair and that he had jumped into it and
settled himself to sleep before the excitement was
fairly over.</p>
<div class="img" id="img005">
<img src="images/img005.jpg" alt="(uncaptioned)" width="500" height="388" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Peter had mentioned the charge against the Lawsons.
Judy&rsquo;s mother had gasped, &ldquo;Kidnaping!&rdquo; and
Clarissa had said quietly, &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t their daughter, Mrs.
Bolton. I don&rsquo;t know what they would have done to
me if I hadn&rsquo;t pretended. I led them here. I knew
Judy would help me. You aren&rsquo;t supposed to tell people
what your husband does for a living, Judy, but I&rsquo;m
so glad&mdash;glad that you let it slip out in the restaurant.
Did you get my letter?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;We turned your letter over to the FBI,&rdquo; Judy told
her. &ldquo;But who planned this welcoming party? I don&rsquo;t
understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like parties. I like pretty girls, and I am especially
fond of getting exclusive stories&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace! You did it. You perfect dear!&rdquo; cried Judy,
throwing herself at her brother and giving him a resounding
kiss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save the mush, Sis,&rdquo; he said, embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a wonderful idea!&rdquo; Judy exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all real friends!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clarissa&rsquo;s laugh rang out. &ldquo;Am I real? Am I really
me? I&rsquo;ve been Francine Dow and Clarissa Valentine,
but now I think I&rsquo;d like to be just plain old Clar Boggs
and go back to West Virginia to my real folks. Pa&rsquo;s
a preacher just like I said, but we&rsquo;re real old hillbillies
for a fact, and I&rsquo;m sick to death of pretending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to be an actress any more?&rdquo; asked
Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe later when things are cleared up and I
understand&mdash;&rdquo; Clarissa said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll clear them up right now,&rdquo; Judy interrupted.
&ldquo;Sit down, and we&rsquo;ll explain everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re explaining I&rsquo;ll bring sandwiches and
coffee. There&rsquo;s cake, too. I still can&rsquo;t make tender pie
crust,&rdquo; Honey confessed, &ldquo;but my cakes are good, and
Mother Bolton&rsquo;s sandwiches are delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Mother Bolton? Judy looked at her brother. Was it
that serious? Honey blushed and said hastily, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
your mother, Judy, and you and I are sisters. She
doesn&rsquo;t mind if I call her that. Sit down, everybody,
and I&rsquo;ll pass the stuff around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy ate half a sandwich and drank a full cup of
coffee cooled with cream while she considered where
to begin. It was a long story. But it really started in
the restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clarissa, that cashier who tried to cheat you was
arrested on some other charge. Peter told me about
it,&rdquo; Judy said. &ldquo;The police picked him up. It wasn&rsquo;t a
federal offense, but the subliminal advertising that the
golden hair wash people put on is a different matter.&rdquo;
She explained to Clarissa about the messages that had
been flashed on the screen too fast for their conscious
minds to be aware of what was being suggested.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you kept saying your hair was &lsquo;dull&rsquo;
and &lsquo;drab&rsquo; and why we all rushed out and bought that
shampoo when we didn&rsquo;t really want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did want it,&rdquo; Clarissa protested. &ldquo;I went
back to the dressing room on purpose to get those two
bottles I left there. I was going to come right back,
but the first thing I knew I was being rushed into a
costume and pushed out on the stage. Someone
whispered, &lsquo;Watch the cards,&rsquo; and I read the lines, but
I was never so scared in my life. If my hair hadn&rsquo;t
been covered up with that golden wig I don&rsquo;t think I
could have played the part at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You played it beautifully,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Clarissa smiled and tilted her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could play Sleeping Beauty without a wig now.
Did you notice the change?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I used that
golden hair wash.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/chapter.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="28" /></div><h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />Talking Pillows</h2>
<p>Judy had noticed a change in Clarissa&rsquo;s appearance.
The shampoo had made her hair fluffy and
bright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like mine,&rdquo; Honey said. &ldquo;You sounded so
strange over the telephone, Judy, when you asked me
not to change the color of my hair. Why were you so
afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it the way it is. I guess that&rsquo;s why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like mine?&rdquo; Clarissa asked plaintively.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t use much of the shampoo. It hardly changed
the color at all. It just brought out the golden highlights.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely,&rdquo; Judy had to admit. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the product.
It&rsquo;s the way they advertise it that&rsquo;s wrong. Peter
calls &lsquo;hidden sell&rsquo; advertisers thieves of the mind,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;but he says mind control can be used in
another way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is interesting,&rdquo; Horace said. &ldquo;What is this
other way our minds can be manipulated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure. Peter said something about talking
pillows, but he may have been joking. I never heard
of a pillow that talked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it works like a Mamma doll,&rdquo; Holly suggested,
and everybody laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell us, Peter,&rdquo; urged Judy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pillows I spoke of,&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;are supposed
to change a prisoner&rsquo;s outlook on life by what is called
sleep teaching. They contain taped messages that are
fed into his subconscious mind while he sleeps. &lsquo;You
are filled with love and compassion&rsquo; is one. For all I
know Lawson&rsquo;s &lsquo;Do good and gain good&rsquo; may be
another. I don&rsquo;t know how well they work. A study
is being made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a study?&rdquo; asked Judy. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
want anybody sleep-teaching me. I want to know
what I&rsquo;m learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody agreed with Judy except Clarissa. She
said she thought she&rsquo;d like such a pillow if it would
make her stop dreaming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a terrible time,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
been able to draw a peaceful breath. I found out right
away that this couple had planned to kidnap Francine
Dow. They were so angry when they found out I&rsquo;d
substituted for her that I knew my only chance was
pretending I cared for them and wanted them to be
my mother and father. They thought they had my
mind controlled, I guess, but they didn&rsquo;t. All the time
I was awake I was making plans. The nights were the
worst because I did have nightmares. Maybe they&rsquo;ll
stop now that I know what caused them. I thought
fear did. I was never so afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t afraid any more, are you?&rdquo; Honey
asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Clarissa replied with a deep sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with
friends now&mdash;real friends. It&rsquo;s all over&mdash;all the fear
and the pretending. I know I can act now, and I
think I can take things a lot better, too. I mean little
things like my brother&rsquo;s teasing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to find my brother&rsquo;s teasing pretty hard
to take, but I teased him right back, and I guess there
were times when it was harder on him than it was on
me,&rdquo; Judy said with a glance toward Horace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet your brother wouldn&rsquo;t remove the glass
from a silver mirror on purpose to make you think
you didn&rsquo;t show. They tell lots of witch tales at
home, and one of them is that if you look in a mirror
and don&rsquo;t see your reflection, a witch has stolen the
real you and you&rsquo;re a changeling. But now that I&rsquo;ve
really been stolen by a witch&mdash;That&rsquo;s what she is,
Judy! That Mrs. Lawson or whatever her name is.
She looks like somebody&rsquo;s mother, but she&rsquo;s nothing
but an ugly old witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any such things as witches,&rdquo; Judy
laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe it,&rdquo; Clarissa continued, &ldquo;but I do
know I&rsquo;m no changeling. My brother was just trying
to play a joke on me when he took out the glass and
then put it back to prove he could see himself in the
mirror all right. I&rsquo;m going to tell him I know, and
then he&rsquo;ll confess to it. I thought it all out, but I still
can&rsquo;t understand why I didn&rsquo;t show on television.
Everybody could see me when I took Francine Dow&rsquo;s
place on Irene&rsquo;s show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A picture tube blew out,&rdquo; Judy started to explain.
&ldquo;That makes the picture close in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawsy me!&rdquo; exclaimed Clarissa, reverting to her
mountain slang. &ldquo;I let a little thing like that scare me
into a faint?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t let the big things scare you. Now that
you know how brave you can be, I guess the little
things won&rsquo;t bother you so much, will they?&rdquo; Judy
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sure won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll write to you all and tell you
how I&rsquo;m doing and I&rsquo;ll see you&mdash;I mean, maybe you&rsquo;ll
see me on television one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The party had been a little tiring, Judy realized,
after her guests had gone home. She picked up Blackberry
and laid her head against his velvety black fur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those prisoners can have their talking pillows,&rdquo;
she said to Peter. &ldquo;I prefer a pillow that purrs. For
the rest of the evening we can just relax and watch
television. Oh, how I wish we could watch Irene!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judy&rsquo;s wish came true a few weeks later. A postcard
came with the good news. Or was it good? The
card didn&rsquo;t say who Irene&rsquo;s sponsor would be. Surely
Irene hadn&rsquo;t gone back on her decision! Would it be
golden hair wash? Judy was almost afraid to watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Peter tuned in the set just in time for her to hear:
&ldquo;... bring you our own Golden Girl, Irene Meredith.&rdquo;
And suddenly there was Irene as natural as
though she had just stepped into the living room.
And Irene was not alone on the stage. Little Judy was
peeking out from behind her skirt like a small pixie.
Judy couldn&rsquo;t believe it when she heard what they
were about to sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Irene can&rsquo;t sing that!&rdquo; she exclaimed, turning
to Peter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; Peter motioned for silence as the song began.
Little Judy&rsquo;s small, piping voice could be heard
on the second line. By the third line she was singing
all by herself:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;<i>I might sing and play like Mommy on TV or radio,</i></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3"><i>But I wouldn&rsquo;t do commercials,</i></p>
<p class="t5"><i>No, I wouldn&rsquo;t do commercials,</i></p>
<p class="t7"><i>No, I</i> wouldn&rsquo;t <i>do commercials</i></p>
<p class="t9"><i>And innerup the show&mdash;</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was Irene who interrupted, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just couldn&rsquo;t get that one word right. Judy
Irene is only two and a half. I wouldn&rsquo;t interrupt the
show either. But I do want to introduce a very good
friend of ours, Clarissa Valentine! She will appear on
this show regularly and will star again in <i>Sleeping
Beauty</i> two weeks from tonight. Right now she has a
message from our new sponsor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>The message was brief and in good taste. The sponsor
turned out to be a nationally known manufacturer
of cereal. Clarissa opened a box and poured out two
servings of what she called crispy, crunchy nuggets of
golden corn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how they&rsquo;re going to work it. Clarissa
won&rsquo;t mind doing the commercial,&rdquo; Judy began, but
again Peter held up his hand for silence. And suddenly,
right there on the TV screen, was Judy&rsquo;s own little
namesake doing a commercial and not even knowing
it. For she sat down at a table opposite her mother
and began eating the golden nuggets as if they were
the tastiest things in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re good, Mommy!&rdquo; she said between mouthfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like them, too. Why don&rsquo;t you try them?&rdquo; Irene
asked the TV audience as the commercial ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will,&rdquo; Judy answered as if Irene could
hear her. Then she turned to Peter with shining eyes.
&ldquo;It was a joke!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They sang the song
just for fun, and the studio audience enjoyed it. Did
you hear the laughter? But it does prove truth can
win if we stand up for what we believe. Oh, I&rsquo;m so
glad Irene talked to Mr. Lenz that day. She almost
made the wrong decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t if those golden nuggets really are as
good as the sponsor would have us believe,&rdquo; Peter
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sold on them,&rdquo; Judy declared, laughing.
&ldquo;And it didn&rsquo;t take any &lsquo;hidden sell&rsquo; to do it. Just
watching little Judy sitting there gobbling them up
was enough. I&rsquo;m going to buy a box tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
